KLH wrote a complete PDP-10 emulator (several varieties of processor) in C,
and it runs ITS and TOPS-20.  It is not released yet, but I believe he's
working out the licensing and related issues right now.

A while back (over a year ago?) he gave a little demo by booting up
the emulation (runs as a regular job under UNIX), logged into it over
the network (yes, it even emulates the ARPANET IMP interface), and
sent mail from ITS to a mailing list on the Internet containing a
wallpaper of running PEEK.  So, it works pretty well, I guess!

Don't send him mail bugging him about it, though, or it we'll never
see it!  When it's released, there will be announcements about where
to get a copy and all that.
