   There was only one version of microcode for the KS-10; it was the same for
   TOPS-10 and TOPS-20.

True.  But...

Certainly the same microcode image was used for both Tops-10 and -20, but
there was a mode-bit somewhere that selected which of two totally separate
microcode routines handled the fault.  So in some sense, there -was- some
Tops-10 specific microcode hackery.  (Eventually, microcode space got so
tight that DEC introduced a microcode assembly-time switch so that they
could select which kinds of paging were supported -- I don't know which
possible images were actually used.)

I used the Tops-10 page refill microcode as my model when I wrote the ITS
page refill microcode.  It was a real lifesaver that it was so separate
from the Tops-20 microcode -- it meant that I could see what gyrations I
had to make the micromachine perform without first having to understand all
about Tops-20 paging!
