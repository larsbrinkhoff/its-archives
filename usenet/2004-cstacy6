All this talk of MDL in relation to HAUNT is just some random confusion.

The OPS4 system, in which HAUNT is written, was implemented in INTERLISP.

MDL (aka MUDDLE) was a atrange kind of Lisp that ran on just one of
the ITS machines: MIT-DM.  MDL was later  ported to TOPS-20.  
MDL was very different from all the other Lisp's at the time, and would
look strange to a Lisp programmer of that day or this day.  For example,
it did not use parenthesis.  MDL was used almost exclusively by only the
small group at MIT where it was developed, which is also who wrote ZORK.
MDL was not used much anywhere else in the world.  It was not used in the
rest of Project MAC (AI/LCS by then), which used MACLISP (PDP-10) and
Lisp Machines, and some SCHEME.  

(I wrote my first ITS program in MDL.  It's function was to boot
people off the machine who were playing ZORK during busy hours!)

HAUNT had no connection to MDL.

My memory has faded about HAUNT, and I don't think I ever played it,
but all the other ITS hackers I asked were very definite that HAUNT
did not run on ITS.  This would make sense, since we didn't have
INTERLISP on ITS.  (Well, maybe INTERLISP could have been made to run
under the TOPS-10 simulator, but I don't recall anyone doing that.)
We had HAUNT on our TOPS-20 machine circa 1985.

I also don't think there was any such thing as "CMU LISP" at the time,
I think CMU folks just used INTERLISP and maybe MACLISP.  I wasn't at CMU.
I do know that a few years after HAUNT came out, there was "CMU Spice Lisp", 
which was tracking the emerging Common Lisp spec.  But Spice Lisp did not run
on the PDP-10.  Its cross-compiler ran there, but the target was Perq microcode.  
Around 1985 it was renamed "CMU Common Lisp", and they started writing a novel
compiler for it that did amazing type-inferencing optimizations. CMUCL has
become one of the major implementations of Common Lisp, very popular today.

(In fact, I'm using it right this minute...)
