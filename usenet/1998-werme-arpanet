The ARPAnet started in 1969, CMU was on the net in a year or so.  I
think I installed the first RFC 542 FTP client in September 1972 just before
vacation, largely driven by the AI group's claim that Stanford would
have their server running real soon now.  (Got back from vacation and
found my code didn't work.  Sigh.)  The new Telnet was implemented in
73.  Ed Taft at Harvard did TOPS-10 servers for FTP and TELNET.

When I got to DEC, I joined a group looking into terminal protocols
for DECnet.  I pushed for TELNET (and the ARPAnet protocols), but people
seemed intent on a protocol to fit DEC's needs.  If I had gotten there
about six months earlier perhaps I could have influenced things
better, but then again, there were some pretty strong personalities to
deal with and the NIH syndrome was pretty well entrenched.

Actually, there were a couple good things in ANF-10's terminal protocol,
but the whole company would have done better embracing the ARPAnet
protocols.  Better late than never!

When I joined DEC, Harvard and CMU were the only TOPS-10 systems on
the net.  Rutgers joined a year or so later.  It was all public domain
code.  DEC did a ARPAnet project, but that was after I left in 1978
to join a small company in NH working on a Z80 based printer.

To confirm the answer - ITS was on the ARPAnet, it had TELNET and FTP
and file sharing.  It had no use for DECnet or ANF-10.
