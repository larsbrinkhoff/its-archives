Yup.  This bitstream orientation, and the PDP-10 dominance of that time, 
is why the protocols were all big-endian (much to the dismay of the PDP-11 
crowd).

On a PDP-10, the 32 bit 1822 header and 40-bit NCP header were read as two 
36-bit words; the remainder of the packet was read in either 36-bit mode 
or 32-bit mode (left-aligned in the 36-bit word) depending upon whether 
the socket bytesize was 36 bits vs. 8 or 32 bits.  Those three were the 
only bytesizes that were used for all intents and purposes; PDP-10s 
transmitted 7-bit data in 36-bit mode.

When "long leaders" (32 bit as opposed to 8 bit ARPAnet addresses) came 
about, I read the first two words in 32-bit mode, the next two in 36-bit 
mode, and then switched based on the socket bytesize.  I wrote the first 
long leader NCP for the PDP-10 (on WAITS); at that time only TIPs and 
apparently one or two UNIX systems supported long leaders.  Dave Moon 
followed with a long leader implementation for ITS doing the same thing a 
week or so later.

It took BBN much longer, and apparently my long leader implementation led 
to some facial egg at BBN ("what?  Some kid at Stanford did in less than a 
week what you've been working on for YEARS?").  Apparently, the BBN 
interface (and later the Digital AN20) couldn't switch modes more than 
once in an 1822 message.  So they ended up giving up on 36-bit mode 
entirely and doing the whole thing in 32-bit, thus dooming the Tenex and 
TOPS-20 world to bitshifting for ARPAnet.

TCP, of course, is entirely 8-bit, and there's no guarantee of any data 
alignment on 32-bit word, much less 36-bit word (especially when packet 
fragmentation happens).
