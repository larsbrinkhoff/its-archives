There was indeed a PDP-1 timesharing system at MIT, and I believe
it's where the "capabilities" protection concept was originated.

My sources are: myself (ITS hacker) and various friends of mine who
had developed and used the PDP-1 timesharing system.  If you would
like a more "legitimate" reference, I think that Jack Dennis published
at least one paper about it: a CACM article entitled, "A multiuser
computation facility for education and research".

Wasn't "Hackers" the book that spelled TECO "TICO", and Multics "MULTIX"?
