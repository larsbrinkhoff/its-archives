    No.  Most tourists weren't telnetting in from elsewhere.  Most were on
    TIPs.  MITRE-TIP and NBS-TIP were in Virginia.  ACCAT-TIP and AMES-TIP
    were elsewhere.  They would support 300 bps dialup.  Some of them were
    reputed to support 1200 bps, but since nobody I knew could afford a
    1200 bps modem, it didn't matter.

Minor nits:

1) TIPs used telnet...
2) 1200bps (vadic) modems appeared on the market in about 1980, right?
   (at about $1/bps IIRC) Before that there were some 1200/150 split speed
   modems (at stanford, maybe elsewhere?
3) I dunno about "most people used tips."  I seem to recall that a lot of
   people showed up as connected from other hosts.  Spent most of my time
   on ITS via  a tops10 (with local terminals at a whopping 2400bps!)
   running SUPDUP (had to write the SUPDUP program first, of course!) The
   SUPDUP client I wrote was SO much faster than the tops10 telnet client,
   perhaps largely because it used a larger bit allocation (which would
   probably be called a "window" these days.)
