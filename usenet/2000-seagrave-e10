I'm still here, and still hacking.  It's just slow going.
I took a break from coding when my stepdad was diagnosed with cancer (He
is making a recovery, he's alive and kicking! [swearing and swinging too
^_^]) and I never really recovered from it.

I'm currently toying with a rewrite (Yes, again), this time using pthreads
and other stuff.  The current stumbling block is that I still have no idea
how do handle math, and nobody has a decent explanation of it.  I have it
decoding instructions, and using the console in the normal manner (PI 0
requests, not writing directly into memory).

(Basically, I ran into some DEEP DEEP pits, I forgot to allow for the KL
accounting timers and the ITS XCTR (XCT Relocated) instruction, and a
rewrite currently looks more attractive than the massive surgery a fix
would entail.  I also made some incorrect assumptions as to how the
hardware worked, mostly in the PI system, which would need even more
surgery to fix.)

I'm trying to beat that KS guy to release but I don't think I'll get it... v_v

I also have a copy of kx10, I'm hacking on that too.  When I get stuck on
one, I switch to the other and hack awhile.  (The way they're written is
different enough that I don't have to worry about crossing code.)
