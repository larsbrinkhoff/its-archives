Hmm.  I think that that this overlooks an important segment of the market: 
customers who bought platforms that would support their pre-existing 
solutions to their business problems.  That is, the customer had the 
solution, but needed to expand the number of engines that executed the 
solution.

There was quite a debate in the 1980s between those that favored fewer 
large powerful engines (sometimes creating a monolithic engine from 
existing smaller engines) and those who favored loosely-coupled clusters 
of many, smaller, less powerful engines.  The debate was eventually won by 
the latter due to economic factors; the Great Monoliths fell to the Killer 
Micros.

The KI10 was the perfect TOPS-10 engine.  It was an significant upgrade 
from the KA10, even more than the modest processor speed improvement would 
indicate, because its memory map made it possible to get rid of The Big 
BLT.

I suspect that most TOPS-10 customers would have been happy with a 
lower cost (and less power-hungry) KI10-class CPU instead of a KL10.

The KI10 was not particularly satisfactory for ITS and Tenex because its 
memory map simply was not up to the requirements of a pager; both ITS and 
Tenex had custom paging hardware added to their KA10 systems.  Tenex was 
ported to the the KI10 anyway, but KI10 Tenex was never particularly 
impressive.  Most of the KI10 Tenex systems were dual-CPU systems to get 
any sort of reasonable performance.
