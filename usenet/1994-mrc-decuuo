DECUUO was originally written to bring up the Stanford drawing program 
(SUDS, called D on ITS machines).  As such, it emulated WAITS, not 
TOPS-10, in its original form.  RMS hacked it to make it more in line 
with TOPS-10, and later on I hacked it to bring it up somewhat to 6.02.  
[It was I who got MACRO to run under ITS.]
