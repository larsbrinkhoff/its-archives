There are some contemporaneous published accounts, perhaps most notably the
Stewart Brand article in Rolling Stone.

Anyway, are you sure you wouldn't rather hear about amazing stories of IBM 407
plugboard programming?  At the MIT radio station we had, umm, liberated one
board, which had to serve eight different purposes, selected using three of
the four toggle switches that lesser plugboard programmers used for minor
variations on a single theme.  (For example, in our board, the fourth switch
was used to double-space the printout.)  [I've just re-read this before
posting and I'm not sure the point is clear, so let me try again.  Mostly
people used one switch to mean one thing, but we used three switches to
represent a binary number 0-7 that selected one of eight totally different
functions.]

But it was also because of the radio station that I found my way to the AI
Lab, which was the loosest computer facility about letting hangers-on use the
machine.  At the beginning it was a PDP-6, and was mainly used for single-user
interactive computing with a signup sheet, but the signer-up could choose to
boot up ITS and let other people use it also.  We used it to maintain the
mailing list for the radio station.  I was a freshman, so I was amazed when I
tripped over a bug in TECO, and reported it to one of the glorious system
hackers, who said "I'm busy, why don't you fix it yourself?"  That was how I
learned to program the thing.  My big contribution was to add the sort command
to TECO.  Its name was ^P because all the other characters were taken!  I was
really proud of it because it didn't just sort lines; it took three TECO
command strings as arguments:
	1.  Move from beginning of record to beginning of sort key.
	2.  Move from beginning of sort key to end of sort key.
	3.  Move from end of sort key to end of record.
and it started at the beginning of the buffer and ran these three in rotation
until reaching the end, then started sorting.

Then one day Richard Greenblatt walked over, stroked his chin, and said, "I
guess we ought to start paying you."  That was my first clue that people
actually got paid to do this stuff in college (although I had worked at IBM
the summer before, which is a story in itself, but not for this group I guess.
:-)

I've been really lucky -- I worked at the MIT AI lab at just the right time to
get to hang out some at the mill with the PDP-10 gang, and I worked at the
Stanford AI lab at just the right time to hang out some at PARC when they were
building the Alto.

I also vividly remember the conversation I had with Tom Knight in which I
said, "I just can't understand it -- my program works most of the time,
but..." at which point he broke in with "you're using the value in the AC
after a BLT" and of course he turned out to be right.

But I feel a little shy writing about all this stuff because mostly it's
stories about other people's hacks, and they should do it!  Like 0$$^F for
example...
