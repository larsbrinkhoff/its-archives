From memory I know it predates 1971. I joined DEC in September 1966.
Soon thereafter a couple of the PDP-6 types went to visit Project Mac
at MIT. When they returned one of them (perhaps Tony Wachs) was waving
a Dectape around and saying something like, "Wait til you see what
we've got here! It's called Teco."

As received from Mac it was described as a screen editor. The text was
displayed on a tube (the 340?) with the current pointer blinking. On a
TTY one had to sort of use one's imagination.

When it was developed at Mac...I'm not sure.
