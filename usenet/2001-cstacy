Mark,

I think your memory is failing you, here.

ITS implementation of TCP-IP was begun on November 10, 1982,
nearly single-handedly by Ken Harrenstien, and MIT-MC was
doing TCP on December 19th.  The other machines began running
the TCP version of ITS on flag day: MIT-AI started running
ITS 1312 on December 31 at 21:03-EST and it all worked.
That included SMTP, FTP, TELNET, MLDEV, etc., etc.

I obtained the reclama for the ITS systems, but that was for the
benefit of people at other sites that were stuck with NCP.

The ITS systems ran on hardware that was in the process of
being decommissioned shortly after that.

Chris
