I implemented ITS's first version of a GRIPE command.  It was a
synonym for MAIL TK (because, as a lowly ignorant freshman, I'd
found that Tom Knight was the best bet for getting a quick and
friendly answer to beginner questions).

That lasted about an hour, until Tom came to work and found his
mailbox full.  He changed it to MAIL SYS, and that's how it worked
until someone invented vectored gripes.
