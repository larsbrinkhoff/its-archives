> ITS (Incompatible Timesharing System), late 1960s

I don't think Steven has ever used ITS. He clearly doesn't get the file
name convention. Although I admit hierarchical directory structures
would be nice and six characters feels small, ITS feels rather modern. I
admit that I have only used it on emulators, but I think the real thing
wasn't that much different, although possibly slower.

Even in the ITS 1.5 Reference Manual (AI Memo 161A) from 1969, that
early version reads very much like a fairly modern operating
system. Indeed, some modern operating system has still far to go to even
match its features (PCLSRing, for instance).

Scanned original here (I was the one who once asked the nice librarians
at the AI lab to scan it and publish it on the net):
