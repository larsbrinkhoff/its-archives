Many TOPS-20 systems didn't have the MDL software on them, so there was a
little matter of packaging etc. to make it easy to run ZORK/DUNGEO(n) on
a vanilla 10/20.  Every time a new version of Zork came along this was re-
done by one of the LCG guys (I won't post the name here); the full Zork
sources were most definitely not publicly available in those days!

I was not implying that the version running on the LCG machines (or on
several other 36-bit machines in other facilities) was the FORTRAN port;
that was for the 16-bit boxes.
