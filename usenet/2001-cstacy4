Yes, Zork was written in MDL. By the time that people were 
interested in it, the source code was being carefully guarded.

The Zork implementors were very careful to prevent this from being
likely, and went on to commercialize the program.  If you do manage to
find a copy, I would suggest contacting the owners of the program for
the legal permission to make a copy of it on your computer.
Perhaps at this point in time, they would be ammenable.
