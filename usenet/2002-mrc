You probably should.  I find it interesting though that most of the people
who criticize Interlisp have never really used it, but rather rely upon
the say-so of third parties.

It really was an East Coast/West Coast thing.  Lisp bounced back and forth
between BBN and Stanford for a while, culminating in Lisp 1.6 at Stanford.
A bare-bones distribution of Lisp 1.6 got onto DECUS tapes and never was
updated, thus convincing an entire generation that Lisp was useless.

I don't think that MacLisp started with Lisp 1.6; I think that it came out
of Lisp 1.5.  There is no doubt that it was *the* Lisp for ITS.  Later it
was ported to TOPS-10 and was the only serious Lisp that ran on that
platform; however TOPS-10 was never a serious Lisp platform.

I think that BBN came up with the first Interlisp, which quickly became
quite popular on Tenex systems.  The Stanford AI Lab never upgraded to
Tenex, and the majority of the Lisp community there moved to the SUMEX
project at Stanford, the AI Lab at SRI, or Xerox PARC, all of which had
Tenex systems on which Interlisp was a major application.

Thus, Lisp languished on John McCarthy's system (JMC was, of course, the
inventor of Lisp).  In the late 1970s, Guy Steele and Richard Gabriel got
MacLISP running at SAIL but by then SAIL was long out of the running as a
Lisp shop.

Xerox came out with its Lisp D-machines (Dolphin, Dandelions, Danetigers)
which were Interlisp and quite nice as development platforms.  Think of a
Smalltalk box that used Lisp instead of Smalltalk.

Most people today only know about Common Lisp, the language which was
built to merge all of these divergent Lisp dialects and to sell Symbolics
Lisp machines...  It succeeded in the former but not the latter.

Anyway, Guy Steele's little poem above is cute, but remember that he was
in effect Mr. MacLisp for many years.  He is hardly an unbiased source.
For a great many people, Interlisp was a wonderful development
environment, and DWIM did the right thing 999 times out of 1000.  Nobody
ever understood GLS' claims of DWIM screwing the user; it never made
things worse, often made things better, and in any case could be turned
off.
