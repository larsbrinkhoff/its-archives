Just to chime in, we didn't usually call ITS "the monitor" either.

And HACTRN was not a program, it was (normally for almost everyone)
simply the name of the user's toplevel process.  Each user process 
can have any tree of subprocesses in a hierarchical control arrangement.
Normally users have a DDT at the top which they use as their general
command interpreter (and also debugger) to control their job tree.
HACTRN was normally loaded with a program named DDT, hence the "HACTRN
is DDT" minor confusion I've seen on these threads.  A few people used
other programs (such as Lisp) as their toplevel.  Daemon toplevel processes
(eg. the mailer or the accounting system) were not called HACTRN and of
course were running some useful daemon program (not DDT).  (However you
could patriate any process, not just your own, to move under your DDT
for debugging).

Ummm.. I think we just called the kernel in ITS, "ITS" or "the system".

The word "monitor" suggested the monolithic design where the user
command interface is the same program as the kernel, but ITS was
already way beyond that...not bad for the 1960s!
