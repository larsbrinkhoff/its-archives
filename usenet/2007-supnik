Sorry to disagree... at the time I started working on the game, which
was written in MDL and ran under ITS/TOPS-20 on the PDP-10, it was
called Dungeon.  The PDP-10 version was <later> renamed to Zork
because of potential confusion with (and possible legal action by) the
Dungeons & Dragons board game, which later still became a computer
game.

I never bothered to rename the PDP-11 (or VAX) version, and it was
always known as Dungeon.
