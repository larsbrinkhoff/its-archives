I always consider vi to be part of the west coast line (TV, E, TVEDIT, 
etc.) instead of the east coast line (TECO, EMACS).  However, there was 
certainly cross-pollinization between the two lines.  Although most people 
in the 1970s and 1980s were firmly in one camp or the other, almost 
everybody had familiarity with the other side.

I, personally, never learned vi; but my E skills from WAITS transferred to 
vi well enough that I can do simple editing on a system which lacks emacs.

DEC TECO was crippled until the release of TV-TECO in TOPS-20.  TECO, as 
written by Dan Murphy, always was a display editor.  I'm sure that Dan can 
chime in with a lot more history.

TECO (by this I mean the program on MIT ITS) remained much like the 
TOPS-20 TV-TECO program over a decade later until RMS visited SAIL in the 
early 1970s and saw E and its real time editing features.  This was, 
indeed, a critical turning point and RMS was part of it; he implemented ^R 
mode in TECO which was its first real-time editing.  Some familiar 
commands, such as ^A, ^B, ^D, ^F, ^K, ^N, ^O, ^P, ^V appeared during this 
time.

Other people quickly developed macro packages, and by 1976 there were two 
major ones: TECMAC and TMACS.  There were also personal variations as 
well.  For example, I had an extended version of TECMAC which had meta 
commands to operate on words the way that control commands operated on 
characters, and convinced RMS that this was an important basic 
functionality.

EMACS was created in late 1976/early 1977 by a group of people, including 
RMS, Guy Steele, and Dave Moon, in an effort to unify TECMAC and TMACS. 
I take credit for the design in which commands such as ^X^R (read file) 
prompt you for a file name instead of opening a TECO minibuffer with the 
necessary TECO commands and the cursor placed where the file name should 
go.  I nagged RMS into making that change.  [Yes, it is undoubtably true 
that RMS did most of the programming -- but he did not operate in a 
vacuum!]

EMACS would have languished in obscurity and died when ITS did, were it 
not for the effort of Mike McMahon, one of the most brilliant programmers 
that I have ever met.  MMcM did "the impossible": he ported EMACS to 
TOPS-20!

MMcM's port is another critical turning point in the history of EMACS; and 
had this not happened I am convinced GNU would not have happened since 
nobody would have paid any attention to RMS in the early 1980s.  RMS got 
the attention and support he needed to launch GNU because he was the 
developer and distributor of EMACS for TOPS-20.

Sadly, MMcM gets very little credit today; he deserves more.  I should 
also mention that he was the original author of the TOPS-20 mailsystem. 
I am most associated with it, and did indeed write some of its components 
(most notably the SMTP and IMAP servers).  But MM, MMAILR (originally 
XMAILR), and MMAILBOX (originally XMAILBOX) were created by MMcM; I have 
always attempted to correct people who call me the "author of MM".
