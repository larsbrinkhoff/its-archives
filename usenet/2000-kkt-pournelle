May, 1985, according to the archive posted to this newsgroup by Tim
Shoppa, and there was quite a bit more to it than simply mentioning
the net.

I think the golden age was over by the time the Apple II made it big,
and certainly by the time the IBM PC was introduced.

Was it explicitly placed in the public domain?  Under post-1978
copyright law, works are copyright immediately upon creation, whether
it has the little copyright symbol or not, unless it's released.  If
there was no explicit release, you'd have to argue intent.  Or was it
entirely created with government funding?  Hmm.
