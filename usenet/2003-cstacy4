No, that story is not true.

However, the command for shutting down the system (in a normal
manner)) was available to all users.  In fact, there was almost
no security of any kind on the entire system.  It wasn't needed.
This had nothing to do with reverse psychology.  It had everything 
to do with the fact that the users on the machine were all assumed 
to be reasonable people; who would go around crashing a computer?

If someone used the shutdown command, then you would walk over
to their office a few doors away and ask them why they did that.
If they were not on campus, you would turn off their account
and leave them a message asking why they did that.
