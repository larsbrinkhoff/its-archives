There is some widespread confusion in this thread about this machine
being "AI".  This is not the historical ITS computer named "AI".
That was a KA-10.  The machine on Ebay is a KS-10, which was several
generations of technology later.  When the "AI" PDP-10 finally died
after several decades of use, we got this KS machine to stand in its
place on the network and ported ITS to it.  The historical era was
already over by then.  This KS-10 machine was used for a little while
by a few people to run EMACS and the email server.   Another KS machine
was later brought up under the name "MC" to replace the KL-10 as the
main mail hub.  Aside from the port itself, which included microcode,
drivers, and some changes to the way IO worked on this processor, some
very late ITS development (mostly, implementing some standard network
protocols) did occur on these KS machines.  At the time of the KS port,
essentially everyone in the lab had already long switched to TOPS-20
for document processing, and Lisp Machines for research programming.)
