Assuming you mean the TECO version, rather than Emacs in general (written for
the most part in Lisp for a long time now).

Partly maintenance, partly development:  On the assumption that TOPS-20 would
go on longer than ITS (and it has, since it is still used in XKL router
products instead of an IOS-style interace), I made the decision to change from
the old ITS naming convention for "compiled" libraries (LIBNAM :EJ) to one
which is friendlier to TOPS-20 and at the same time still quite usable on ITS
(LIBNAM ELIB).  Of course, in TOPS-20 there's a period instead of a space
between the first and second names (in Tops-10/TOPS-20 parlance, filename and
extension).

This was something I did first in my own version, and then carried over to the
main code branch.  It had ramifications in a number of places which were not
obvious on simple inspection.

That was in the 1990s, before the Y2K fix.
