Brian's reply seems only to have made it to comp.lang.logo.  He posted there:

I know about the BBN work only second-hand.  When I met up with Logo it was
at the MIT lab that Papert set up post-BBN, running on a PDP-11 under a
homebrew operating system called SITS (Small ITS, named after ITS, the
homebrew operating system on the AI Lab PDP-10 upstairs.)  (For those who
aren't ancient computer experts, the PDP-___ numbers don't reflect the size
of the machine.  The PDP-6 and PDP-10 were the large DEC computers; the
PDP-1, PDP-8, and PDP-11 were the small (mini-) computers.  The -10 was
an enhanced reimplementation of the -6, but the three minicomputers were all
quite different from each other.  (If you're wondering about the -2, -3,
-5, and -9, they were designed but never built in large quantities, I think.)

DEC was sort of the Apple of their day; they never had more than a tiny
sliver of the computer-sales pie, but most of the great ideas can be traced
back to those machines, especially the PDP-1 and the PDP-6/10, especially
the ones at MIT and Stanford.  For example, TECO, the first programmable
text editor, was a product of the Tech Model Railroad Club on the MIT PDP-1.

I wish I knew more about the details of the BBN work so I could address with
first-hand information the anger some people feel whenever Seymour claims to
have invented Logo.  (What I know for sure is that he was part of a group
organized at BBN by Wally Feurzeig, and that both Seymour and Wally made
important contributions there, as did a bunch of other people.  And that
Logo today is quite different from the earliest BBN version, so there's a
sense in which Logo was reinvented later, which is one thing that complicates
the question.)

Anyway, the glory days of the MIT Logo Lab, including that no-statistics
proposal we've been discussing on another thread, was built around the
PDP-11 Logo implementation.  This started before there were microcomputers,
let alone Logo for micros.  Both the TI-99/4 Logo and the MIT Logo for the
Apple (the origin of what's now Terrapin Logo) came out of this group after
the early research using the PDP-11.  Hal Abelson was, I think, the main
person pushing the development of implementations that people outside MIT
could actually use (meaning both the TI and the Apple projects).
