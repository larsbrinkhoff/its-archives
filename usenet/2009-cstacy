ITS was in use for a very long time by a lot of different people
ranging from secretary's, random email guests, MACSYMA users, computer
science and AI researchers, system programmers, and others. 
They all had different skill sets and interests and it also changed
over time. (For example, TECO was around a long time before EMACS.)
I would say that Most programming (not counting the macros programmed
by people for their document preperation in R, Pub, TeX, etc. or their
editing macros in TECO) was done in MACLISP. MACSYMA users wrote a lot
of code in MACSYMA. There were other languages (MDL, SCHEME, and higher
order AI languages) that were heavily used, and some standard languages
(FORTRAN, PASCAL, C, etc. some under TOPS-10 emulation) that were really
never used.  Mostly only the system programmers wrote programs in MIDAS.
