Ok. As they say: To everything, there is a time....

I just got the new power lines run into my spare bedroom//computer room. Two 
20amp 120 volt circuits, and a 20amp 240 volt circuit. Enough power to fire 
up my 2020 (AI), a pair of RM03's, an RM80 (totally unformatted) and a TU77 
(condition: Odd)

Now, a question: When I try to boot off the TU77, I get a console error. 
Checking the Massbus registers, it appears that the 20 is setting an "Invalid 
density value" in the drive density CSR. Odd thing is I can't clear the error 
by poking INIT commands into CSR1.

Does the 20 support the TU77 as a boot device, or am I going to have to roll 
a TU45 in here to get things up.

Also does anyone have any diagnostics on RM03 packs (or even better, TOPS20)? 
I ate one of my T20 packs in a head crash a few years ago.

Speaking of which: The pack failed as follows: Years ago I tried to clean the 
heads on an RM03 with 97% isopropyl alcohol and lintless swabs. Bad idea; 
just touching the heads must have screwed the flying geometry. When I put the 
pack in, and fired the drive up, the heads marched out and promptly gouged 
scores into the media. Didn't do any seeks, just plugged the outside track.

Would it be suicide to put this pack into another RM03? Anyplace left out 
there that might be able to recondition a pack? Or was the outside track 
track zero?

Thanks
Chris Zach
(PS: Once the TU77 is running, ITS goes up)
