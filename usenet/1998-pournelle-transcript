OK, here it is.  The log files below have moved with me from account to
account over the years, but I believe that I originally found them
on MC.LCS.MIT.EDU in 1987 or so.  These files were widely circulated
at the time; I was extremely surprised to not be able to find them
on the web today.  I suppose the point-and-click generation simply
doesn't care about anything that happened over a decade ago - which
is too bad, as there's a fascinating amount of history contained
in the the attached file.

                HOW JERRY POURNELLE GOT KICKED OFF THE ARPANET



   This file explains why Jerry Pournell <POURNE@MIT-MC.ARPA (ex-tm)> is
   no longer on the ARPANet. It's in chronological order. I hope this
   clears up any misunderstanding and confusion that may exist.

   Hi,

   I didn't see your original messages, and I don't know how the NIC got
   into the loop, but I am indeed the person to answer your questions.

   Apparently you have encountered TAC access control (TACACS) on your
   favorite MILNET TAC. TACACS is a login system based on encrpytion
   codes recorded on little paper cards which authorized MILNET TAC users
   are being issued. To be a MILNET TAC user, you must have a personal
   TACACS account and be issued one of these cards, so that you can type
   your login code to the TAC and make it happy. People establish TACACS
   accounts and get cards by contacting me to get registered.

   If you stick to using ARPAnet TACs, you will have no trouble, since
   TACACS for the ARPAnet is going to be a little different and has not
   been completely figured out yet.

   MIT is not sponsoring guest/tourist usage of the MILNET; if you are a
   guest, you should just switch to using a TAC on the ARPAnet and avoid
   the problem. I can provide you the name of an ARPAnet TAC in your
   area, but I cannot authorize you to use it or provide you with
   telephone dialup numbers.

   I will soon have some "Guest TACACS cards" for authorized MIT people
   on our machines who need to use a MILNET TAC but have not yet been
   registered for their own personal cards. These cards are confusingly
   named: they have nothing to do with guest accounts and are not
   available to tourists/guests.

   To put it straight: in general, you are up a creek, and there really
   isn't very much to be done about it. Feel free to ask me further
   questions or whatever though.

   Cheers, Chris

   You used the word "ARPANET" in your June Byte column three times. You
   even said

   "I gave Alex the local ARPANET access number to record for the
   1200-baud modem and inadvertently transposed two numbers."

   I don't care if Alex IS a computer -- you may soon find your accounts
   on MC decremented by gov't order.

   USER-A is the mailing list created explicitly for dealing with these
   sorts of issues. It is the appropriate forum for discussion. There are
   eight people on user-a. You probably know better than I do, but last I
   heard about 100,000 times as many people read BYTE. Thus, the issue of
   privacy is the last one you should raise.

   I don't particularly want to force you into ritual disembowelment;
   rather, I'm interested -- and I'm not the only one -- in why you find
   it necessary to flaunt your use of the arpanet. The more attention you
   (and other people) draw to non-blow-em-up use of the arpanet the more
   likely some Proxmire type is to start inquiring into its operations.

   Personally, I'd just turn off his account. It's not like it's the
   first time, and he not only flaunts his use of our machines but stabs
   us in the back with grumblings about why he doesn't like this or that
   program of ours when he gets a chance. (Am thinking particularly of an
   article he wrote which condemned Lisp for reasons amounting to little
   more than his ignorance, but which cited Teach-Lisp in a not-friendly
   light... The man has learned nothing from his presence on MC and sets
   a bad example of what people might potentially accomplish there. I'd
   rather recycle his account for some bright 12-yr-old...)

Re:   WESTERCON 38 and The Pournelle/ARPANET Split



   We attended the WESTERCON 38 SF convention held in Sacramento, CA,
   over the July 4th weekend. At WESTERCON we talked with Jerry Pournelle
   about why he never contributed to the SF-LOVERS bb since he had an
   account at MIT-MC. He said his account at MIT-MC was terminated by
   some "graduate student" in charge of accounting, who felt he did not
   have a need for an account. He knows who this "graduate student" is,
   and he refuses to grovel so that his account is reinstated. However,
   he asked us to broadcast this little story - presumably so that MIT-MC
   will come to him.

   BTW - if you ever get a chance to meet Jerry Pournelle, you will not
   be dissappointed. Sequel to FOOTFALL:-)

   HARPANET FOR PRESIDENT,

   HUSENET FOR VICE-PRESIDENT.

   Also planned is a sequel (and a prequel) to THE MOTE IN GOD'S EYE.
   WESTERCON 38 was run very well. In addition to Jerry, we spent several
   hours talking with Greg Bear, Norman Spinrad, Robert Adams, James P.
   Hogan, Larry Niven, John Brunner, and David Brin.

   ---end forwarded message---

   He might still have an account if he could keep from using words like
   ARPANET and DARPA in his column in BYTE magazine!

   You might consider contacting Byte about publishing some note from us
   to appear simultaneously with this. This is only important if
   pournelle is going to say what I think he is going to say (what JMC
   told me pournelle was claiming), which is that the reason his account
   was flushed was because he favors the Strategic Defense Initiative,
   and MC is run by a bunch of communists. This will no doubt please
   darpa immensely.

   Pournelle claims that he heard at a science fiction convention that
   you (chris) had said that the real reason his account was flushed was
   that ``he (pournelle) is a fascist.'' Given the current political
   climate, this could raise some sort of ruckus, so it would probably be
   good to nip this in the bud.

   All we have to to is warn Byte that MIT will sue the magazine if any
   incorrect defamatory comments are made by Pournelle. I am sure the
   editors there have the same opinion of him that we do and will make
   sure that Pournelle doesn't end them up in court.

   As it stands Pournelle really doesn't understand the state of the
   world. If he insists on printing his delusions then MIT's case would
   be trivial to win.
