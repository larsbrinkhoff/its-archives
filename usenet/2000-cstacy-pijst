We put that feature into ITS late in the game (around 1983 I think).
It gave a software interrupt (%PIJST) to the current program, which,
 if not handled, was handled in some standard way by the superior
(eg. the shell).  We used the sequence "^_^J".  The ^_ is an escape
character (since all the control characters like ^T are normally
available to applications) and the ^J was mneumonic for "job".
This was coded into the TTY driver kernel; I don't remember
exactly what the user-level side (DDT) did with it.
It was just a hack, and I'm not sure it was ever actually used,
but I stole the idea from TOPS-20.

ITS was normally used from a display terminal (CRT), and so there was a line
called "who-line" that sat on the bottom (or top, if you wanted) of your screen 
constantly displaying status information about the CPU and OS and the application.
So you didn't have to go asking for it: it was right there in front of
you all the time. 

But with the ^_^J feature, a program could do something special, 
or the debugger could tell you something about what was going on.

There was a ^T command in DDT (typed to DDT itself, when it had control
of the console, not when some running or stopped program had TTY control)
that did something completely unrelated (filename translation mapping).
