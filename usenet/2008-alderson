Well, ITS (the Incompatible Timesharing System) was first coded for the PDP-6,
which is architecturally very close to the PDP-10, and was later ported to the
10.  MACLISP, one of the important influences on Common Lisp, was written in
MIDAS, the PDP-6/10 assembler created for ITS.  From MACLISP came not only
Common Lisp, but also Scheme (and Rabbit, a Scheme compiler) and MACSYMA.

MACLISP was ported to TOPS-20 (and its ancestor TENEX), which may seem very old
to you but which is still under development at XKL, as well as to WAITS.

There were several other lisps for the PDP-10, under different operating
systems.  John Sauter mentioned LISP 1.6, which I believe ran under Tops-10 and
WAITS (the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory derivative which
diverged very very early).  BBNLisp => Interlisp (later ported to a family of
Lisp machines developed by Xerox).  Portable Standard Lisp (from Utah, basis of
the REDUCE mathematics package, similar in spirit to MACSYMA).

And there is ELISP, Rutgers' original implementation of Common Lisp, written
for TOPS-20; eventually, this became TOPS-20 Common Lisp.

All of these (with the possible exception of Utah's PSL, I simply don't
remember for certain) were all written in assembler and Lisp.

The C-based Lisps, such as Franz, were PDP-10 Lisp wannabees.
