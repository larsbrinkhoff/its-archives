Time's up.

Both commands showed a "systat" or "who" type display of who else was on 
the system, what they were running, etc.

tty <CTRL/F> showed the directory of the TTY: device, that is 
the contents of TTY:.FILE. (DIR)

tty <CTRL/K> ran the TTY program, which showed the same directory, only it 
output each character in a random order (albeit at the correct screen 
position).  It was quite the neat thing to watch.
