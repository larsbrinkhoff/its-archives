Can you expand on what you believe was better about the process
structure in ITS than in TENEX?  TENEX didn't have such sugar as
the ENVironment being passed in a standard way, but that's pretty
much a frill, easily added.  Did ITS have that?

I did some coding for ITS over at the AI lab.  Mostly porting some
tools from DEC to ITS and vice versa.  But nothing that needed
multiple processes.  I did write tools in TENEX that used multiple
processes.

I didn't mention in my previous list the process splice mechanism:
EXEC above a USER process.  USER process croaks, either a loop
or a crash of some sort.  EXEC, on command, says "splice a debugger in."
Now the structure is EXEC above DDT above USER job.  All the detritus
from the crash is there to be debugged.
