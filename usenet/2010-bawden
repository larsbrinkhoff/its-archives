The ITS file system stored a byte size and byte count for every file, so we
weren't quite that lame.

But although the file system could represent any byte size from 1 to 36,
there was no way to write a file except in 7-bit or 36-bit mode.  And even
then, there were a lot of old programs that ignored the byte size when
reading and did all their I/O in 36-bit words and stripped padding in the
last word.

So it's clear that some ITS hackers in the early 70s were looking ahead and
tried to start doing the right thing, but they never got finished.  (One of
several unfinished ideas projects in the ITS kernel.)

And just to add to the full horror of the situation, you may recall that
ITS used the character ^C for padding instead of NUL.  But since we often
got files from folks running other flavors of PDP10 operating systems,
quite a few ITS programs would strip either NULs -or- ^Cs at the end of the
last word.  What a mess.
