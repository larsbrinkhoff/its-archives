For outside users, ITS had passwords in the 1980s.  (The last ITS was
taken down in May 1990.)  For users within MIT, or telnetting from
"safe sites," passwords were never required.

In the 1970s, there were no passwords for anyone.

Right.  Disk space was scarce in those days.  Guest users such
as myself had to share.  My files were typically named
DSK; USERS2; KFL FOO for various values of FOO.

I wonder what URLs would look like today if ITS had caught on rather
than Unix.

I always welcome replies to my e-mail, postings, and web pages, but
unsolicited bulk e-mail sent to thousands of randomly collected
addresses is not acceptable, and I do complain to the spammer's ISP.
