The ultimate source of TOPS-10 TECO was the reimplementation of Dan 
Murphy's PDP-1 TECO on the PDP-6 at the MIT AI Lab; that is, a very early 
version of ITS TECO.  That program most definitely had display support, 
and was always used on the 340(?) display.

Bob Clements brought a copy to DEC and ported it to the DEC monitor.  The 
display support did not survive the port, probably because most PDP-10 
systems did not have displays and were used with remote Teletypes.

If you don't take my word for it, I have a videotape of the 1984 
roundtable with Richard Greenblatt, Bob Clements, Dan Murphy, and other 
luminaries where they discuss this history.

It was a mystery to the original authors of TECO that anyone would ever 
consider TECO usable without a display.
