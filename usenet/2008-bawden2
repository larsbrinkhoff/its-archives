I think that 8080 code was generic enough that it would work with any disk
attached through an RH11.  (Again ignoring the speed issue.)  Certainly we
booted from RM03s and even an RM80.  We never hacked the 8080 -- we only
had a listing of the code that it ran.

(Actually that RM80 only partly worked.  We managed to reformat it in 18-bit
mode, and you could boot up and run ITS for weeks, and then the drive would
suddenly fail and nothing short of repeating the 18-bit format would bring
it back to life -- empty.)

It's also possible that I was never planning on booting from that RP07.  I
recall starting to work on a kludge that would boot a KS10 by typing the
microcode in through the serial console...
