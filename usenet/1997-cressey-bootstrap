All this talk about the RIM10B reminds me of a bootstrap
I had to write.  It had to fit in 16 words.   Not the 
accumulators, but, I think,  locations 20 through 37.

It had to load ITS  (well, actually a secondary loader
that would load ITS)  from a disk.  Not only the pdp-10 code
but also the channel program had to reside in the 16 words.
That was tight!

For those of you who may not recognize the reference,   ITS was
the incompatible timesharing system,  which was built at the MIT
AI lab to run their PDP-10s.  I worked at Dynamic Modelling, just
down the hall from AI.
