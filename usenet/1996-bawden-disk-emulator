Yeah, we had that working for a while.  I'm not convinced that the RM80
support for 18-bit mode really worked though.  It was often the case
that when you powered the drive up your data was gone.  We never figured
out exactly what the problem was, but I developed the superstition that
you were -more- likely to lose if you powered the drive up when it was
write-protected (you read that right).

To answer a question someone else asked: yes it was Systems Concepts
that
marketed a box that emulated RP06's and RP07's.  We almost got one at
MIT
to keep our ITS machines running when our RP06's became unmaintainable.
It was rather pricey as I recall...
