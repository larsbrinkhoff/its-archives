I'm assuming you've gotten these files either from the collections
on ftp.ai.mit.edu, or ftp.swiss.ai.mit.edu, or else from the ITS
"final snapshots".  Alan Bawden wrote a program called "EVACUATE"
to archive the contents of the machines on to a Unix filesystem,
and that is what produced these files.  The program converted the
36-bit words from files in the ITS filesystem, to 8-bit bytes to
store in the Unix filesystem.  One thing that was really neat about
it is that the conversion caused text files from ITS to be converted
ASCII text files on Unix that are directly readable (i.e., with
"cat", "emacs", etc.) without needing any special tools.

The best place I've seen this format explained is within John Wilson's
"itstar" program.  Look at ftp://ftp.dbit.com/pub/pdp10/its/itstar,
and pay particular attention to the file "unpack.c", whose comments
describe the conversion format in detail.
