I wasn't trying to be disingenuous.  Rather, I was not sure of the
history of the version that was outside of MIT.  As you noted below,
there was the original PDP-1 version.  I assumed that Dan Murphy took
that with him, but I am less sure about whether that particular version
of the code was the basis for the widespread "DEC TECO" on the PDP-10.
Maybe I should have said "on at least one occassion".

Dan Murphy invented TECO on the PDP-1 at the spark chamber 
in Building 26.  Much of the hacking on the program was done
by other people from the Tech Model Railroad Club on the PDP-1
that was brielfy located there while waiting for the new
"Project MAC" to get its act (and its computer room) together.

"ITS TECO" is what people who used "DEC TECO" called the program
that "ITS TECO people" simply called "TECO".  The actual program
in question was originated on the PDP-1, quickly ported to the
PDP-6 because the PDP-1 was taken away after a few months.
That same program, simply called "TECO", ran on that very
same piece of PDP-6 hardware which also little while later ran 
the ITS operating system.  The original TECO hackers were exactly 
the same people who were the first Project MAC hackers.
But it was a lot simpler to just say "the lab", since we're 
only talking about one group of people and the same computer.

There was continuous development of that same "TECO" program the 
from the PDP-1 to the PDP-6, and on to the PDP-10.  Nobody there
ever called it "ITS TECO" (even when it ran on ITS); it was just
called "TECO", same name, same source files, same hackers, etc.

Except of course, that there was another "TECO" out there
at some point.  Well, maybe more than one other version.
I am unfamiliar with the exact linneage of "DEC TECO", 
which is why I said "at some point" in my message above.
For example, if it was all based on an original root,
that have come from the PDP-1, PDP-6 or PDP-10 version 
of the original program at MIT.  I am sure that Dan Murphy
could have gotten the latest version that everyone had been
hacking the hell out of at any time he wanted after going to BBN.
If I had to guess, I would think that DEC TECO is most likely
based on an embryonic version from the PDP-6, not the PDP-1.

The people who ported TECO to the PDP-6 were the same (other) people
who hacked on the PDP-1 version of TECO.  The port was done over a
weekend by Greenblatt, Nelson, and Holloway, but I don't think Murphy
was there.  Those are the same people who did things like add support
for ASCII to TECO on the PDP-1, and who later, along with a bunch of
others, added most of the features to TECO on the PDP-6.  I think they
are also the same hackers who brought you "340 Display Mode", evolving
the program beyond its paper-tape origins into a visual editor.  
They are also the same people who were writing ITS.

In the context of the history of EMACS I thought people would want 
to understand where EMACS's version of TECO came from.  In particular,
the features that made it possible to write EMACS were invented
during TECO's evolution when it was an ITS program, and originally
EMACS necessarily only ran on ITS.  That's why, when they became aware
of the program, people outside of that community called it "ITS TECO".

My claim is merely that the people at MIT who hacked on TECO 
from its original creation on the PDP-1 to the later years on ITS, 
called their program simply "TECO", and that it represents the
continous development path of the program.   (Also, that "DEC TECO"
was viewed with some derision, when it was brought to their minds at all,
which was approximately never.)  Whether anyone wants to label that as
the "authentic" vesion of TECO is something I don't have an opinion about.
