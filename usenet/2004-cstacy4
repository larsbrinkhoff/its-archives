I am actively using programs that were originally written in the late
1960s and has been continuously developed since that time (the most
recent significant work being Y2K fixes).  The software that I'm
talking about includes TECO, EMACS, and MACLISP on the ITS operating
system. This is running on an emulated PDP-10 (hosted atop an x86
Linux box).  This is continuous -- the emulation (not my instance) 
was running prior to turning off the last hardware PDP-10s at MIT 
in late 1980s.  The emulator was written by Ken Harrenstein, and I 
think the first time I saw it running was on an early Apple laptop.

(It can also run TOPS-20, but that OS is of course much more recent.)
