Bill has a pretty good memory!
The program he's referring to went like this:

	  jrst [type dspc,/AThat name is not known.

		sosge failct
		  phaser
		jrst pwhel1]	   ;help him out
	type dspc,/AThere is no password associated with that name.

	  ret
	pjrst acoun1		   ;give him help!


For you PDP-10 programmers out there: The ^P is an escape code
that's part of the API for the terminal-independant display system,
a very cool feature in ITS.  The  kernel would translate that string
into an intermediate representation in the output buffer.
Then, upon output the TTY driver would interpret that into a program
of the appropriate actions (which might have to be emulated on some
underpowered terminals) using the escape codes for whatever type of
terminal was connected (or re-connected) at the moment of output. 
^PA means "beginning of fresh line if needed".

Here's some of the help text from the program:

/,/Applications for accounts can sometimes be done online.
Do :ACOUNT to find out if online applications are being accepted.  
If they are, simply answer the questions which :ACOUNT asks you,
and a USER-ACCOUNTS person will process your application quickly.
If you are in a particular hurry, you may contact USER-ACCOUNTS
people by sending network mail to USER-ACCOUNTS.  
You should come back later and check if your account has been approved
by attempting to log in.

It was possible to get a guest account if you had some
affiliation with another ARPANET host, or if you were
an MIT student, or even if you were a totally unknown
unaffiliated random high school student from another
part of the country.   There were not too many of those.
I think we all knew each other.  Anyway, all you had to
do was come up with a good excuse about what you wanted 
to use the computer for (eg. what research you wanted to
conduct), and seem like a reasonable person.  

 Yeechang> I'm curious what happened to such guest accounts

 Yeechang> Or do some/many still survive to this day?

They were mostly eliminated as time went on.

Computers come and go, and their names get retired, 
and people move on to other places, and then they 
don't have any need of the old computer account anymore.
And most places periodically clean up and get rid of
old accounts, especially ones that are gratuitous.

I can think of at least one friend, though, who had a guest 
account at Stanford back around 1979 who still has it today.
I think she might have been affiliated, though, at some 
point in the middle of that time.

Those were back in the days when you could count the number of
computers in the world, and most of them cost several million 
dollars each, and there was certainly no public data network.
There were few people in the world who had ever actually seen 
a computer.  Having access to a computer was a big deal,
but there were not lots of people who wanted to do that.

I remember on the ARPANET when the Radio Shack TRS-80 came out 
for Christmas.  We were suddenly swamped with people who had
learned what a modem was, and had found out the dial-up numbers
by reading articles posted on BBS systems.   We had about three
years with lots of guest applications, and had to put a whole
new procedure in place to deal with them.  Then things calmed
down a little when the military put passwords on the ARPANET 
dialups.  Not long after that, lots more universities were
getting on the network (which was now called "Internet").
So there were plenty of other places to get guest accounts.

Now we have personal computers, and the Internet is public.
If you don't have a computer, you can use one at your public
library, and read your email on Yahoo or Hotmail.
So who needs a guest account?

I think most universities do have guest accounts for people who 
never officially had anything to do with the place, are only
affiliated by having a friend who works there or something.
But guest accounts for totally unknown strangers is unheard of.

 Yeechang> And speaking of MIT, what about people with longtime email
 Yeechang> addresses?  Philip Greenspun <philg@mit.edu> is well known
 Yeechang> for having had the same email address since 1976
 Yeechang> (presumably barring the shift over from bang paths).

There were no addresses "@MIT.EDU" until sometime after 1983.
I don't remember when that started, but I think it was probably
around 1986 or later.   Back in the old days, there were no
domains - just host names.  If Phil's email address was always
at the same lab at MIT, it would probably have been PHILG@MIT-AI.  
We never used UUCP at the AI lab, just the ARPANET, so there were
no "bang paths".  My email address there has been the same since 
1979 (except of course that @MIT-AI turned into @MIT-AI.ARPA, 
then @AI.MIT.EDU, and now it's turning into @CSAIL.MIT.EDU).

I think there are plenty of people who have ARPANET email addresses
older than 1976.  RMS probably had his email address there since 1971,
and there are several people before than him who are still online with
email addresses at that lab.

It depends on what kind of "network" you are referring to.
But if you're referring to the ARPANET/Internet, I think 
it would probably be someone from MIT, BBN, or UCLA.

If you want to count UUCP as a network, just go look up the
person who invented UUCP.  I bet his uname is still the same,
but the host name is probably entirely different.

If you mean the oldest CONTINUOUS email address, still in use,
regardless of network (or no network), and with substantially 
the same host name, then it's probably someone at MIT who had 
the same login name on the Project MAC system, or someone at IBM. 
I would guess someone at MIT (like Corbato or Minsky) though, 
for various mostly non-technical reasons.

If you don't care whether the address is still in use, and just
want the oldest one, and if you want to count any computer that 
had a message system that talked to more than one computer, 
those are much older than true computer networks.

I think the first email address I had was in 1975 or 1976 on the STSC
APL*PLUS system (which would exchange email nightly with its sister
system across the room).  I think that kind of thing was already
fairly old-hat by then. (We wrote similar kinds of email systems as
high school kids back in those days!) IBM already had some kind of 
large corporate computer network by then, didn't it?  
Someone here will tell.

If you want to count any computer that had an "email" system where
people could send and receive messages without both being logged in 
at the same time, even if it didn't talk to other computers, 
then you're going to have to go back to at least 1963.
Probably into the 1950s.

Long ago, we just called it "mail" -- never "email".  "Email" is very
new name for it.  I remember when we were disgusted by the new word,
and vowed that we would never refer to "mail" as "email".
I think that lasted about 5 years before everyone gave in.
But we still usually say just "mail" when speaking to each other.
