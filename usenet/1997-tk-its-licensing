Look, no one (I mean NO ONE) will care if you run ITS on your
machines.  In fact, I'll cheer, as will most of the other MIT hackers
and adminstrators.  I suppose there might be some difficulty in
getting a genuine letter from someone in authority that ITS is in the
public domain.  If receiving such a letter will make you day lots
cheerier, then let me know and I will begin the painful process of
producing it.  As they say, just do it.  Ask forgiveness, not
permission.
