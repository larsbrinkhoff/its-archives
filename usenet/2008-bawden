They were??  Oh man that hurts.  One of the last things I tried to do to
keep ITS running was to get this handy RP07 somebody left us hooked up to
our KS10s (because we were running out of working RP06s).  The changes I
made are in the ITS source code, but they were never tested.

Now you're telling me that I was doomed to failure?  Even though that was
18 years ago, it still hurts to find that out.  Keeping ITS running was
certainly Quixotic at that point, but now you're telling me the windmill
was just about to clobber me big time.  I would have been so pissed...
