In the mid 1970s, ITS ran on three KAs (AI, ML, DM) and one KL (MC).

The AI system had a PDP-6 (which was the former AI system) as a slave 
processor.  By the mid 1970s, it was mostly unused (except to play music 
from time to time).

The DM system was also once a PDP-6.  I never saw that PDP-6 powered up.
