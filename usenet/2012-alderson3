Hi, Charles,

Sorry for not responding earlier.  It's been hectic around here as we move into
our new configuration (new exhibit space, new organization, new visitor model,
etc.), opening on 25 October 2012.

We moved the large systems into a new computer room (raised floor and big HVAC,
5000ft^2 vs our old 960ft^2) on a different floor as part of this.  We haven't
got the terminal lines hooked up yet, and have had some disks die in the mean
time, on the 2065.  We're working on that, and the KI-10 restoration, and the
Sigma 9 restoration, and the KS-10 restorations (1 TOPS-20 v4.1, 1 ITS), and
the disk emulator, and that's just in that room.  We're also working on the
PDP-7, the PDP-8/e, the PDP-11/70, the Nova, the PDP-12, the Interdata 7/32,
the Alto IIXM, and a whole bunch of early micros (our mission got expanded),
all for that opening date.

Exciting times, if slightly exhausting.

I promise to let everyone know just as soon as the terminal lines get hooked up
on the 2065.
