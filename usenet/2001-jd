I know that!

Was this the case from the beginning?  I do not recall having to
enable the shorter commands; but perhaps this was done in an init
file.

What I do recall was that the use of passwords on ITS was not
uncontroversial. One site, in particular (I think it was MC or ML) was
the first to implement a password system.  Other sites (AI?) did not.
And, for awhile at least, the password system would be there one day,
gone the next; or instead of ITS xxxx, you would get a message telling
you to use uname such-and-such with password so-and-so, as if the
system was deliberately fighting itself.  RMS, in particular, was
exercised about passwords and controls of any sort, and was vocal
about the folly of implementing them.

If I recall correctly there were commands like :GUN (this killed a
process) which anyone could use but which logged their use on the ITS
console teletype, so you could tell who was using them. I thought
there had been an attempt to implement more controls than this,
though, and corresponding squabbles within the ITS community about
whether and how they should be implemented.

But memories fade, especially after 25 years away from all of this; I
don't remember the details, any more than I remember commands from ITS
DDT.  I am sure your recollections are far sharper.
