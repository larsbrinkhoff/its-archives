Alan was working on reading the ITS backups. The 'time capsule file system'
paper describes the work.

There is an ongoing effort to recover the rest of the backups. I am hoping
at some point in the future some part of that archive will be made available.
Currently, none of the people involved will respond to my emails.

The problem with the stuff that was put up in the past was there are personal
files in it, which would be inappropriate for general distribution.
