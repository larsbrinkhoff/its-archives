OK, so the MDL sources were used in a VAX Fortran port.  Sorry, I haven't had
much to do with VMS systems over the last 28 years--DECUS NOTES for a while
when I chaired a SIG working group--so the way you worded it looked as if you
were claiming that MDL ran on a VAX.

I just fired up ZORK on a Toad-1:

    Welcome to Dungeon.

    You are in an open field west of a big white house, with a boarded

                            WELCOME TO DUNGEON

        DUNGEON is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
    you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by
    mortal man. Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors
    contained within!

        In DUNGEON the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten
    secrets of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth,
    searching for vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures
    guarded by fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

        No PDP-10 should be without one!

        DUNGEON was created at the Programming Technology Division of the
    MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank,
    Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the ADVENTURE
    game of Crowther and Woods, and Dungeons and Dragons, by Gygax and
    Arneson.  DUNGEON is written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).

        On-line information may be available using the HELP and INFO
    commands (most systems).

        Direct inquiries, comments, etc. by Net mail to DUNGEON@MIT-DMS.

    Your score would be 0 [total of 500 points], in 5 moves.
    This score gives you the rank of Beginner.
    Do you wish to leave the game? (Y is affirmative):

Note that the original MDL version says "PDP-10", not "DECSYSTEM".

I've been carrying that version of MDL, the MADADV save file, and the ZORK
startup program from place to place since early 1978, when it came to Chicago
from DEC HQ.  I've always had hardware on which to play it, but then, I've
been lucky in my career (though some might disagree ;-).

Even better, I can play it on SimH or KLH10 these days, too!
