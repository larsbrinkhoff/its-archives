On a single-user system, TECO (interactive, real-time editing) was
running with 340 display mode by at least 1964 on the PDP-6 at MIT.
It was available under timesharing (ITS) around 1966.

UNIX dates from late 1969: UNIX v1 came out in November 1971,
and it was released as v6 about 4 years after that.

By the time UNIX was invented, TECO had been a programmable display
editor running under ITS for while.  The most popular TECO libraries
were combined to form EMACS in 1974.  (There was also a primitive version
of TECO on DEC's PDP-10 timesharing systems.)  Stanford had a display
editor on their timesharing system (WAITS), earlier I am pretty sure.
vi was part of BSD and was written in 1976, a decade after timesharing
real-time display editors were well-known in the advanced research
community (eg. Stanford and MIT).

I have no idea how responsive vi was on those early BSD systems.
TECO (and thus, EMACS) was only available on the PDP-10, but I
would guess that it would not have been feasible under UNIX.
ITS and Multics had much more elaborate terminal control subsystems
than UNIX had (or has today, even), and were able to run Emacs fine.
I guess if UNIX had appropriate support it could have been ported.

PS. Note that the version of TECO most familiar to people reading this
    newsgroup is probably "DEC TECO", which was a very ancient version
    of TECO, lacking most of the important features that made EMACS possible,
    that was ported from the PDP-1 at MIT where it originated in 1962.
