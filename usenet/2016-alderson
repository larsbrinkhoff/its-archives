Compile TECO > (the MIDAS source file) and load the resulting TECO BIN.  In
DDT, issue the commands

	DUMPIT$G
	PURIFY$G

You now have a TECO environment, set up by EMACS; EMACS TECO in which to
execute the commands

	mmrun$[prfy]$dump$ts nemacs$$
	mmrun$einit$? document$$

(All of this is derived from the Twenex batch control file, in which the
following sequence is executed (IDDT is a TENEX variant which splices itself
into the process tree, giving an effect similar to that of the ITS multi-
forking DDT):

 ! compile the new TECO

 @midas
 *temp_teco

 !Now start up the new TECO, and dump out the environment the init file creates!

 @iddt
 *;ytemp
 *purify$g
 *mmrun$purify$dump$nemacs.exe$
 *mmrun$einit$? document$
 ^Z

 @delete temp.exe

The DUMPIT procedure is specific to ITS, and is documented in the MIDAS source
for TECO.

You need to read the files EMACS1; EMACS TECO, EMACS1; PURIFY >, EMACS1; CCL >,
EMACS1; EINIT >, and INFO; CONV > as well as the TECO source to put all this
together.

If I've made some errors in the preceding, it's been more than 5 years since I
last tried to build an EMACS from scratch on ITS, and I don't remember whether
this was sufficient.  But it's a start.
