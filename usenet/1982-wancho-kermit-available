(An implementation of KERMIT is also available from Columbia
University for the IBM mainframe...)

Abstract (extracted from the doc file):

'KERMIT is a set of programs that implement the "KL10 Error-Free
Reciprocol Microcomputer Interchange over TTY-Lines" protocol.  As the
acronym tries to imply, KERMIT allows error-free transfer of files
between computers over normal terminal communication lines.  The
protocol was originally intended for use between microcomputers and
Digital Equipment Corporation DECSYSTEM-20 KL10 processors (hence the
name), but, happily, the protocol will work between any two computers.

'KERMIT transfers data by encapsulating it in "packets" of control
information.  This information includes a synchronization marker, a
packet number to allow detection of lost packets, a length indicator,
and a "checksum" to allow verification of the data.  Lost or corrupt
packets are detected, and retransmission is requested.  In addition,
various special control packets allow cooperating KERMITs to connect
and disconnect from each other and to exchange various kinds of
information.

'The KERMIT manual and all the associated programs are available to
anyone who asks for them'...  'We encourage anyone who develops new
implementations of KERMIT to send them back to Columbia so they can be
included on the standard KERMIT distribution tape; full credit will be
given to all contributors.  In return, we trust that no one who
obtains KERMIT will attempt to put it on the market, claiming it to be
their own.'

--------------------

We will provide a gateway service at MC for updated source files for
either KERMIT-20 or KERMIT-80.  Please send notice of file
availability to me (FJW@MC) and bug reports, etc., to
EIBEN@DEC-MARLBORO, who made these files available from Columbia.
