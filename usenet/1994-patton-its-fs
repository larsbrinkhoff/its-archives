   I appreciate any pointers to information on the Network file system
   ITS used, especially how it handled network breakdowns.

You've already gotten sufficient descriptions of operations from MRC
and TK, so I'll defer...although I will point out one thing about the
reliability issue.  Since all I/O in ITS (whether network or not) was
transactions (we didn't always know enough to call them that, but they
were) which either did or did not happen and everything was consistent
in between, this was preserved across the network, except for one
minor thing.  If the remote machine crashed or the link broke, just as
you were committing, you could not be absolutely certain of whether
your action had happened, you know you got a lost connection, but
could never be certain if it happened before or after the commit
point.  This was, of course, trivial when compared to the number of
ways NFS can trash your file system.  The ITS file system was
inherently more robust.  Unlike the early UNIX hackers, early ITS
hackers would spend their time fixing file system code rather than
file systems.  In the long run it paid off...

   Online information preferred, 

Well, the best online descriptions are the two just posted (presumably
now in the archive at Univ. of Washington...  For more details than
you probably care for you could always look through the preserved
copies of the last ITS file systems at MIT.  I think the file that
documents this use is in there somewhere...  Use anonymous FTP to
MC.LCS.MIT.edu (which was the name of one of the ITS systems until it
was retired) and look in /its.  Since, here in the future, you have to
use NFS and not MLDEV, access to these may not be reliable.

P.S.  Now that I have a house with a huge basement and a large
electrical entrance, anyone got a working KS10 in the Northeast
looking for a home?  I'd love to have one in my collection...  Sorry,
no three phase (but maybe with enough incentive, it _is_ available on
the pole out front :-).
