On ITS (ca.1967) user processes were accesible as part of the filesystem.
The device name was "USR" and the file name consisted of the username
and unique jobname.  Processes were called "jobs".  In fact, opening
such a file was the only way to perform most process manipulations,
such as: creation of jobs, reowning disowned jobs, selection of existing
jobs, and testing for the existence of a job.  This is also how you
read or wrote a job's memory, and accessed its control variables.
