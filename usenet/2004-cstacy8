I think that Multics probably invented the hyphen for introducing
command line arguments, as part of the idea of a strictly uniform
command syntax.  That's where Unix got its "switches".  

Various systems used hypens and slashes in commands to indicate 
things like ranges.  I would guess that the Multics UI designers 
just thought that hyphen looked neater than slash or anything else,
and in particular did not look at all like IBM JCL.

Not on Multics, where they just indicated options.

The way I remember it, most operating systems just spelled out 
command option keywords (though they could often be abbreviated),
seperated by spaces or commas.  Sometimes the equals sign was put
between option keywords and their arguments (such as file names).
IBM's TSO, CP/CMS, etc,, and GE/Honeywell's GCOS all work along
those lines.

I am not sure what CTSS did (well before my time).
It is possible that there were no command line options.

ITS didn't have any command options in its toplevel command shell,
but it had a provision for passing the command line to a program,
and many programs did take options.  There being no system standard,
each program parsed its command line differently, variously using
all of above mentioned ways of indicating switches and options!

I think Dennis Ritchie would be able to provide a good answer 
to a lot of these questions.
