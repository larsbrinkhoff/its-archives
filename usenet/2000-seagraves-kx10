Nope.

Not all of it.  IIRC the system itself was placed under the GPL or some
other free license not too long ago.  I might be wrong.  In any case, I
can give you system stuff (unless someone objects) but I can't give you
home directories.  The problem is sorting out which is which, which won't
be known until we get ITS running again on an emulator.  So I really can't
give out anything outside of AI:SYSTEM; (and SYSENG; and obvious stuff)
without getting in trouble.

It's not that I want to keep ITS secret, or any of the other stuff I have
- I'd very much like to be able to distribute kx10, as well as my patches
for it.  But Stu asks that it not be distributed, and it's his emulator.
As far as the CD, I had to pester people for a few months to get it.
I think MIT will get mad and do nasty legal things to me if I make it
publicly available.  THAT'S why it's not available.  I'm not wanting to
keep it mine or keep people from seeing it - I'm afraid of the legal
asswhipping I'd get for making it available.

As for kx10, Stu says no distribution, and it's his program, so that's
that.  He wrote it, it would be wrong of me to go against his wishes.

(BTW, Stu's primary concerns seem to be that he doesn't want to have to
explain to everyone how to be a TOPS-20 operator, and the legal issuses of
distributing OSes.  Like me, he too is afraid of a legal asswhupping.)

> There do seem to be several on-line archives of AI:HUMOR, at least.

Yes.  You have one of them.
