The "real" ITS machines were KAs, except for MC (the KL).

ITS was only ported to the KS after after we stopped using the system
as a primary tool. The KS was an endgame: essentially nobody used ITS
for real work at that point.  ITS had not even been reliably available
for use for a while because The KA hardware was very old and flakey. 
IIRC, the ML and DM machines were already junked and out the door
before this, and the AI machine was only operating sporadically.  
The exception was that the MC (KL) machine was still being a mail
routing hub, a job that was subsequently taken over by one of the
later KS machines.

Before the KS port, we had already moved on to Lisp Machines for a
number of years, while essentially all document preperation (which 
is all that time-sharing was used for) was being done on TOPS-20.

Well, there were still also a very few MACSYMA users on the KL then, 
but most customers had purchased their own Lisp Machines or VAXes.
