GRIPE EMACS would mail to BUG-EMACS (which was a mailing list to which
one could subscribe), etc.  You could still say GRIPE with no argument
and it would still, iirc, MAIL SYS, as would GRIPE with an argument for
which there was no corresponding BUG-XXX alias.

In the SAIL version of vectored gripes, you could list more than one
program, in case the problem was in the interaction of two programs:
GRIPE E,MAIL meant GRIPE E and GRIPE MAIL with the same message.  I don't
remember whether that existed in the ITS version (sorry).
