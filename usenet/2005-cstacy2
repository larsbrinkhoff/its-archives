Not to dispute that TOPS-20 was designed to better allow "fascism",
but perhaps I should sometime quote a lot of the email I used to
receive as an ITS administrator.  One of the popular nicknames
bestowed upon me was "The Incredible Flushing Man".  :)

Agreed.

However, its exactly those features (along with the more
sophisticated networked file system on ITS) which led to the 
infamous battle cry:   "Six letter filesnames were never this bad!".
Too bad we didn't rewrite the ITS filesystem (for hierarchical
directories and security), and implement extended addressing.
Then we could have stayed with ITS for the remaining few years.
But we considered it too late by then for major PDP-10 development.

We had already long moved onto the much more futuristic Lisp Machine.
The thing taken from TENEX and TOPS-20 to the LispM was the idea of
the uniform programmable command processor.

Speaking of features, ITS had pipes.  This was somewhat like Unix,
but predates it, and was fancier (for example: it included interrupts,
and it worked transparently over the network).  But most people were
unaware of this feature.  there was no invocation syntax in the shells, 
so users could not easily access it.  These pipes (accessed via the
CLI/CLA/CLO devices)  were really only used by the SEND program and
the shell itself as the IPC mechanism for inter-user text messaging.

Absolutely nothing, of course, was taken from TOPS-10 for our advanced
operating systems.  Before 1968, our PDP-10 operating system had already
far surpassed the capabilities that were ever available in TOPS-10,
