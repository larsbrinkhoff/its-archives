The picture is some model of DECSYSTEM-20.  It is not possible to 
determine from that picture if it is a KL10 (2040, 2050, 2060, 2065) or 
KS10 (2020); a few more inches to the right and it would be possible.

Being a DECSYSTEM-20, it is also a PDP-10.  It did NOT "have the same CPU 
as a PDP-10", it *is* a PDP-10.  A DECsystem-10 is also a PDP-10.

It is thus correct to say, assuming that they ran TOPS-20, "they had a 
DECSYSTEM-20", "they had a DEC-20", "they had a -20", and "they had a 
PDP-10".

It would not be correct to say "they had a DECsystem-10" unless they ran 
TOPS-10 on that machine (which I think is unlikely).

Nor would we say "they had a -10" (as opposed to "they had a PDP-10") 
unless they ran some operating system other than TOPS-20.  If, for 
example, they ran ITS (possible on a 2020), then we would could say "they 
had a -10" since in spite of the paint job it was not a DECSYSTEM-20.

We would NOT say that a machine that runs ITS is a DECsystem-10, nor a 
DEC-10 (again in spite of paint job).  It is a PDP-10, or a -10.

DECsystem-10 and DECSYSTEM-20 were both marketing terms, and are specific 
to machines that ran TOPS-10 and TOPS-20.  DEC-10 and DEC-20 are informal 
abbreviations.

-10 and -20 are even more informal abbreviations; however -10 could also 
mean a PDP-10 that ran a non-DEC OS.

Does that make things more clear?
