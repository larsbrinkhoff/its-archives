In the *very* beginning, there were no colon commands.  If you were using
ITS, you were an expert!  Or at least you were a programmer, and therefore
familiar with DDT.

I think it was Don Eastlake who added the colon commands.  For a while
you actually had to type the colon; then, later, there was a "monitor mode"
in which DDT printed the colon as a prompt, and if you wanted an old-style
altmode command you hit rubout, I mean delete, to get rid of the colon.

Then after that someone invented the clever heuristic that if you logged
in with :LOGIN FOO it put you in monmode, but if you said FOO$U it put
you in ddtmode.

I don't remember having to enable the ddtmode commands, either, so that
came some time after 1973, when I moved out west, I think.  Unless :DDTMOD
is what "enable" means in this context.

The way I remember it is that nobody was particularly enthusiastic
about passwords, but ARPA insisted; they were starting to get worried
about malicious users net-hopping.  The ability to have a null password
(you just hit return at the password prompt) was the compromise.
But I was in California by that time, so I got much of this second-hand.
