I've created a new mailing list for people interested in hacking ITS,
especially on simulators (since that's the easiest way to get started)
if you don't already own a real PDP-10.  This list is also to support
people using my ITS starter kit (http://www.cosmic.com/u/mirian/its).

To subscribe, send an empty e-mail with "subscribe" in the subject to
<its-hackers-request@cosmic.com>.  The list address itself is
<its-hackers@cosmic.com>.  You must be subscribed to the list in order
to post, to prevent spam (but the list is not archived on the web, so
you don't need to worry about spam-bots.  If I ever do archive the list
on-line, I will munge all e-mail addresses to thwart the spam-bots.)
