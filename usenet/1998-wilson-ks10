One KL-2065 and approximately eleven KS10s, D Bit Troy NY, John Wilson.
   KL-2065 status:  complete, supposedly working before move, no 3-phase here
     (hopefully will be donated to a better home soon)
   KS10 status:  mostly in various states of having been raped for parts
     and/or painted brown, a couple are basically complete.  One of the RM80
     disk drives has ITS installed on it which was run on another KS10 a few
     years ago.
