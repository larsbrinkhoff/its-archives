Tonight I logged into an ITS, running on the
micromachine simulator, which believes that consoles look like
16c450 UARTS, and disks have ATA-2 interfaces.

Fixing ITS to understand a different kind of terminal
and disk was easy. Fixing ITS to understand a model of machine which
was like a KS, but not exactly a KS, was fairly easy too (once
I clued into the fact that "IFE KA10P" really means "IFN KL10P\KS10P").

Finding the microcode bug which caused translation buffer
misses on writes to replay incorrectly sometimes (a joy to find; poke
at the offending location with DDT and the crash goes away because
DDT took the miss on a read), and finding the microcode typo
which caused byte pointers to be read/written controlled by bit 11 of
XCTR rather than bit 10, took a lot longer.

And there are still problems. LOCK crashed the system with
what looked like a stack overflow/underflow trap, which is tomorrow's
debugging.

But at this point I think I believe the architecture of
the machine is sound, and it's time to finish designing and then
build the hardware version of things.
