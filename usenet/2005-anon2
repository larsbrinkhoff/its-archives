Not as much of historical significance as the original TECH was.

However, the problem with the version of TECH-II we found is that it's been
modified by unknown parties in unknown ways for unknown reasons at unknown
times.

We don't know for certain its history.  We can't prove that particular
version is a significant one.

Well... You can read the comments in the files themselves....

For the TOPS-20 one (the one with the damaged source), it doesn't say a lot.
Don't know if this was the original source by Alan Baisley or not.  It
doesn't mention CHEOPS, but that's about all that can be said for sure.

The TOPS-10 version has no source, but the hlp file certainly suggests a
long line of modifications.  That program had definetly traveled some.

The ITS version, which has references to the PDP and CHEOPS has no
documentation with it.

So we don't really know much beyond it existing.

We don't know who wrote modified it, why it was modified, when it was
modified.

We can speculate.  But we don't know for sure.  Unless somebody comes
forward who was involved and can say for sure whether that is or is not
their program or modifications.

Conditions like that are fine for collectors etc., but a professional
quality collection (like what museums do) tend to prefer a bit more
information.

It does have references to the PDP-6, so they may find it interesting for
that reason.  But that's not a heck of a lot compared to what it might mean
(ie: the cheops references etc.)


But again, as I've said, if we have anything they want, they are welcome to
it.  The whole point of collecting this stuff is to put it on the web for
anybody who wants it.  We don't want to hoarde stuff.

Currently, myself, plus the guy who posted it on his ftp site.

Plus, the computer history museum...  Without somebody coming forward and
giving a definite history or accounting, it doesn't have as much value to
it.

No idea where the original author is at, so we can't compare the source to
see what was actually modified.

For us hobbiests, that's acceptable.  We'd prefer more info, but speculation
is acceptable.

Speculation is not acceptable for a genuine archive.

If Mr. Greenblatt or somebody else comes forward and says that was his
modifications, then that's great... it makes the program rather valuable and
significant.

Right.  Common knowledge.

I haven't yet tried contacting them to see if that still exists...
Considering how much reorganization has occured since then, I doubt it.

Still it might... from what I gather, some form of Kaissa existed as late as
1990

Sure, I know a few things about TECH-II...  At least the original version of
TECH-II, anway.  (Have I studied each and every chess program since the
early 60's... No... Do you know how many there have been?!!  By 1980 there
were hundreds.  Heck, by the mid 70's there were more than 50, with many
just being local programs that gained little attention.  No, I can't be 100%
familiar with every one of them... If I was writing a history book, then I
would need to be.  But I'm not writing a book.  Finding chess programs
before they are lost doesn't require me to know the authors nickname or
whether they were left handed, etc.)

But that doesn't mean the program we found is the real TECH-II.

My simply saying "Yes this is the real TECH-II" or "This is the copy that
Mr. Greenblatt modified" doesn't make it so.

That's fine for a hobbiest collector.

A professional quality collectio needs more.

And it is known for certain that one other version in that same directory
*has* been modified by other parties.

Which was not part of the original history of TECH or TECH-II that I was 
familiar with.

That was an event that happened much later.

And no, it's not widely mentioned.

Yes, it was.  Moderately so, anyway.  Not famous well known, but known.  It
and the original TECH were used for a variety of experiments over the years.


> you are talking about.  Which leads me to the conclusion' that you

In what way...  That we can't prove that the copy we found is the real
version?

We can already prove that there have been other modifications because the
hlp file with it says so.

You've made one heck of a jump in reading that reference...

You've made the assumption that the version we have is the version they are
talking about.

You don't know that.

You've just decided that since you don't like me, that I must automatically
be wrong and that you must automatically be right.

The reality is that you don't know the history of the program that was
found.  You are only speculating.

It may indeed be the one being discussed.  But we don't know at this point.


And I readily admit I don't have the original references... As I've said
before, I'm stuck in a rural area with no place around here that carries
those journals.    They may be available online, but since I don't belong to
those organizations I don't have access.


> are wasting people's time, while you deride and dismiss the efforts

"Wasting people's time".... Well, since you seem to enjoy these
conversations, that must mean your time is even less valuable than mine...

> of professional historians and collectors in this area, and assert
> that they have done nothing.  So why are you wasting everyone's time?

"Dismiss the efforts".... And how do you reach that conclusion?

Pretty big jump considering I have said no such thing.

I have said there has been very little effort to collect the old programs.
That's very true.  Some of the authors I've contacted have not been
contacted about their stuff recently.  (And in fact, one of the major
authors from the 70's & early 80's   He hadn't donated his program.  Either
he didn't want to, or more likely, they didn't want it at the time.  He's
also the one who suggested that whatever we collect, we donate to them to
help their very small collection.)

Heck, I'd love to sit back and let them do all the work and reap the
benefits.  I really really would.  It'd be a heck of a lot easier.

But they haven't been.  That's why so much stuff is now lost.

It's only been releatively recent when anybody showed any interst.  Even
now, their efforts are not... extensive.  They've got a lot of areas to
cover.  They don't have the time, the people or the finances to put into an
extensive search.

I've already collected at least as many programs as they have.  More,
actually. Then throw in the ones from people I'm in contact with, and we
probably have couple times more than what they have.  And where as most of
theirs are commercial, most of mine are free, open, and somewhat
historically significant.


You have one very bad habit of jumping to things that were not said.
