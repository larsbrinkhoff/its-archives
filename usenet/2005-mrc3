Also correct.

Basically, when a process was blocked (e.g., in an I/O wait) on ITS, 
location FLSINS(U) (where U contained the process number) was an 
instruction that, if it skips, indicates that the process should be 
unblocked.

Thus, .HANG set the previous instruction as the process' FLSINS.  Of 
course, it had to do a bit more work than that (e.g., on instructions that 
referenced memory) but that's the general idea.

.HANG allowed a timeout value in an AC.  Thus,
 	JFCL
 	.HANG 1,
was equivalent to
 	.SLEEP 1,

Since there was process-process memory mapping on ITS, all sorts of 
semaphores were possible without having to poll.
