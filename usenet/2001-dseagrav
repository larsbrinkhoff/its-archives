Alright.  If you're going to do this, let's try going about it one step at
a time, shall we?

First, you need to make disk packs.  For this you need NSALV, the disk
salvager.  NSALV 260 is the most current version I have.  In any case,
first we have to put a .SBLK at the top of the source file so we get
usable output...

(Done and done...)

Now, we're going to compile for KSRP06, which is a generic KS10 with one
RP06 and one TM03.

And now to compile...

Toad@ MIDAS458 NSALV.260
NSALVATION
Which machine? KSRP06
FORMAT MID included in this assembly
FRN MID included in this assembly.
UBSTST+11	204472	1.	67-008
        RESET   Pseudo, macro or initial sym as label
DSKTS2          206165   1.   103-044   Symbol table full                      
Unterminated successful bracketed conditionals                                 
The first was at 103-004 of file NSALV
Error is fatal.
Run time = 10.65
7919 Symbols including initial ones (100% used)

OK, so we need to make the symbol table bigger.
You do this with .SYMTAB.
I raised the symbol values to 5000 syms and 8003 literals.

So we compile again...  And run out of symbols again.  Raised syms to
8000 also...

And MIDAS crashes.

Here's the run:

Toad@ MIDAS458 NSALV.260
NSALVATION
Which machine? KSRP06
FORMAT MID included in this assembly.
RFN MID included in this assembly.
UBSTST+11       204472   1.    67-008
        RESET   Pseudo, macro or initial sym as label
MHLEN+1         206304   1.   107-137   PDL overflow
Unterminated successful bracketed conditionals
The first was at 105-004 of file NSALV
Error is fatal.
Run time = 9.27
7957 Symbols including initial ones (99% used)
Toad@

I get similar results when using the default MIDAS, which is NOTPUR MIDAS
425.

Ideas?
