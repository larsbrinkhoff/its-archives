As a matter of fact--and I do mean fact, not opinion[1]--SMTP is a TCP-based
mail protocol, defined in RFC 821, so is not directly applicable to either
DECnet or X.25.

As it happens, the MM mail system for TENEX and TOPS-20 was written to be as
agnostic as possible about the underlying mail transport.  When I worked on it
in 1983, the handler (MMAILR) supported 4 modes of delivery for messages in the
mail queue:

    1.  Local - sender and recipient on same machine, use the file system
    2.  Internet - sender local (or relay), recipient on a known Internet host,
	open an SMTP (TCP/IP) connection to the remote host and deliver
    3.  PUP - sender local (or relay), recipient on a known PUP network host[2],
	open a PUP connection to the remote host and deliver
    4.  Chaosnet - sender local (or relay), recipient on known Chaosnet network
	host[3], open a Chaosnet connection to the remote host and deliver.

Most of the code was common, with a few protocol-specific subroutines for final
delivery.

My job was to add MMDF ("phone net") functionality to the MM system so that the
University of Chicago could exchange e-mail with other members of EduCOM's
EduNet facility, which was hosted out of MIT-Multics in a star configuration.
I realized early on that UofC was sadly out of date (~200 edit levels behind
current), got the latest bits from MRC at Stanford, and began a lifelong
friendship which was cut too short last year.

I realize that DEC marketed mail programs called MS and MX which dealt with
DECnet addressing as well as TCP/IP.  These were based on an early version of
the MM package, according to MRC, who did some of the work for DEC IIRC.



[1] I cut my teeth as a TOPS-20 systems programmer extending the MM mail
    system, created by MMcM (IIRC) and maintained for decades by MRC.  This was
    the work that got Mark and me acquainted and led to his pointing me at a
    Stanford job posting, which I took.

[2] This was probably restricted by this time to the Stanford campus, although
    PARC might have been running the MM system on MAXC.  I'm pretty sure that
    SRI was running TCP/IP on their systems (DEC and Foonly) by then.

[3] Done so that the MIT AI Lab ITS (PDP-10) and LispM systems could send mail
    to and receive mail from MIT-XX, which ran TOPS-20.  I don't think Chaosnet
    was used anywhere else.  (Oh, maybe early Symbolics installations?)
