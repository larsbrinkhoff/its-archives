I am pleased to announce that I have a bootstrap distribution available
of ITS for Bob Supnik's PDP-10 simulator.

All the materials can be gotten from my ITS hacking page
	http://www.cosmic.com/u/mirian/its/

My document "Building an ITS from scratch on the Supnik PDP-10
simulator" available from that page should give you all the information
you need to get started.

I've not yet tested this instructions with the 2.7 beta of SIMH which
was just announced.  However, they do work with the latest 2.6b release.

For now, I only have enough of a distribution to get you a minimal
(though functional) install.  However, I hope to add MIDAS, TECO and
EMACS very shortly.
