I *had* some, haven't seen them in a while...  I also found a place in MD
that could clean + inspect them for something like $30-40 each, worth it
if you don't want to trash your drive.

I feel sure DEC still sells them, I've got a slightly oldish DAS catalog
in front of me that gives the part # as 29-22925-00 but doesn't have a
listing for it except as part of the PM kit 4A-PM116-00, which costs $131
but supposedly includes 2 of the filters and 10 prefilters (y'know, the
things that the manual says to wash in warm soapy water but if you do they
turn to dust and disappear).

YES, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  You *must* add a jumper
between pins E06E1 and E06C2 of the RM adapter backplane (that's the cage
that slides out of the base), and then you'll need to reformat it, but
MARK in the ITS salvager does that just fine (note that as distributed,
the RM80 version of NSALV 260 needs a patch to work correctly, see
ftp://ftp.dbit.com/pub/pdp10/its/build.info).  The KS10 that I ran under
ITS at Fornax in '92/'93 had an RM80 system disk and worked great, and
running on 115V with no air filters is a Good Thing.
