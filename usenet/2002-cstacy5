Don't forget that EMACS itself (decades before GNU) was a prime
example of free software in the PDP-10 community. Sharing software
was just what people in the University environments naturally all 
did back then, most of the time, at least at MIT.

Here's the "license" (from the source file) for TECO/EMACS from the 1970s:

;ITS TECO was built by RMS on the work of others
;at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab
;(not to be confused with the Laboratory for Computer Science).
;It was converted to run on Twenex by MMCM at SRI.
;
;TECO is available to those who like the way it is,
;on a basis of communal co-operation:
;you are welcome to make improvements, but only if you consult
;with the other user sites, and send your changes
;to MIT to be merged in and distributed to everyone.

;;;ITS TECO and EMACS should serve as a lesson to all of what can be achieved
;;;when programmers' creativity is not crushed by administrators whose main
;;;concern is stifling humor, stamping out all possibility of enthusiasm, and
;;;forbidding everything that isn't compulsory.

;;;They were produced in a humane anarchy where one man designs, implements,
;;;and then documents the feature that inspires him.  They were produced by
;;;people who could laugh enough to name many years of effort the Incompatible
;;;Timesharing System.  Of course, the whole story is imaginary.  Working
;;;conditions which do not crush the spirit can't be practical.  You can't run
;;;a team that way if you expect to meet the deadline.  TECO doesn't really
;;;exist; you were only dreaming it.

;;;You owe your improvements to us in return for what you see here.  If anyone
;;;asks you for a copy, make sure he gets in touch with the MIT AI Lab so he
;;;can get the latest stuff.
