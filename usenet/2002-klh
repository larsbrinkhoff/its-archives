Would love to send my stuff in, at least.  Note that the code is still
copyrighted by Columbia and the notice says nothing about
modification.  If no one there has time to maintain it, perhaps you
could spare a few cycles to get it GPL'd (or free-forked, etc) so that
aspect doesn't hinder possible development or distribution by others.

Hmmm.  Have used MM+EMACS on NFS configs and seen this on other
places, but can't recall it ever happening on Panix, which uses NetBSD
NFS servers.

You could try making it use temporary edit files on /tmp or /var/tmp,
which normally are non-NFS dirs and have the 1000 ("sticky") mode bit
set so only owners can delete/rename files therein.  I don't remember
if this still applies to Solaris though.

At any rate, clearly this is fixable by conspiracy, with sufficient
motivation; unfortunately I'm not an expert on elisp but I gather you
can do just about anything with it, which presumably would extend to
doing pipe or socket I/O.

As an interesting note, the original PDP-10 EMACS (actually TECO)
maintains its buffer pointers in a specific block pointed to by AC 2,
precisely so superior processes are able to read out the contents
directly from memory.  This is how the QMAIL program snarfs things
back on ITS; I don't remember if MM does the same thing on TOPS-20.

You never know.  Now I'm wondering how many other MM users still
exist, whether because they prefer the UI or because they want old
mail files to remain accessible.
