Urm.  The KLH10 source contains hints -- anytime there is a timeout or
delay, it is there for a good reason -- but the comments don't always
identify the offensive code, largely because at one point I tried to
expunge everything that DEC lawyers might construe as NDA issues.  If
anyone seriously wants to start a new career as a Free-20 monitor
programmer, I would have to go back through my offline notes and
compile (or contribute to) a master list.

By contrast I only found one race in all of ITS, and that was in the
bootstrap.
