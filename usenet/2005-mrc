Well, then, I don't know what's wrong.  Chris Stacy is probably the best 
person to talk to, since he's the most active person doing ITS development 
these days.  He's a good guy to know if you're going to be doing much with 
ITS.

Most of my knowledge of ITS is from the halcyon 3*KA10 (AI, ML, DM) + 
1*KL10 (MC) days of 30 years ago, although I do have a (real) KS10 based 
ITS system (PM).  I remembered enough to debug ITS' RM03 support (RMs 
interrupt in a different way than RPs), but I have forgotten much of what 
I once knew and a lot changed in the late 1980s when ITS was entirely on 
KS systems.
