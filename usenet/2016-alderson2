OK, I missed that.  It was a quick glance.

Yeah, you would have to replicate all the operations of PURIFY :EJ to generate
the :EJ files, and the source files are too large to ER @Y :M(HFX*).

Well, the EMACS sources are also present on the tape; the PURIFY and IVORY
macros check whether you're running ITS or TENEX or TOPS-20 in order to get the
naming conventions correct.

By the way, ELIB files are simply :EJ files in a name which is less cumbersome
for TOPS-20.  When I did the work to update TECO back in the 1990s, there were
no running ITS systems know to me, so I did what was convenient for customers
of my employer at the time.

Based on research I've done in the last couple of days, I think that to build
an EMACS without a preexisting EMACS is a daunting task.  You have to build up
the TECO environment by substituting function definition strings in place of
function calls in TECO.INIT, in such a way as to provide you with callable
functions for later use.  (When I created my own version of EMACS ~30 years
ago, I started from the vanilla version and used my own versions of the
functions in EINIT.  I lost that when I left XKL.  Long story.)

I think the answer is, no one ever did what you want.  RMS et al. already had
bits and pieces of the desired TECO environment painstakingly defined, and
bootstrapped from there.

It's going to hurt.
