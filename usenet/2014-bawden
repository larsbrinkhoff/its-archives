That describes me, I guess...

Unix has set our expectations so that this seems like a natural request.
But historically we didn't think that way...

On Unix, most commands are written with the expectation that they might
be called upon to read from, or write to, a pipe.  A consequence of this
is that we all type "| more" a lot.

On ITS.  commands are written with the expectation that output written
to the TTY: device will always be displayed to a human, output written
to the DSK: device will always be saved in a file, and output written to
the COM: device will always be consumed by another program.  A
consequence of this is that you never have to do anything special to get
"--MORE--" processing, because it's built in to the TTY: device.

So every program that generates output that you might want to save,
generally has its own idiosyncratic mechanism for directing output to a
file.  In the case of the FIND program, an "_" in the command line
separates the output file from the rest of the arguments:

  :FIND FIND OUTPUT_FOO BAR

puts a list of files named "FOO BAR" in a file named "FIND OUTPUT" in
your home directory.  (Recall that the "_" character was a left arrow in
some early versions of ASCII.)

And yes, this can be inconvenient.  It works differently for each
command, and some commands don't support redirecting output at all.  In
cases where you _really_ want to save the output of something whose
author thought that would never be needed, you have to resort to
trickery using name translations, or the CRTSTY program, or ...

For examining arbitrary file contents I used to use the <alt>0L command
in DDT to load the file in to a job and then just use DDT commands to
examine it.  That's actually quite a convenient way to explore arbitrary
data files since DDT has a really rich understanding of how people used
36-bit words...
