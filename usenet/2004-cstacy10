If by "grew up" you mean "became very widespread", 
then I might agree, at least about the Unix part.

I am not sure about the popularity of EMACS on TOPS-20 or even
how many TOPS-20 sites ran Emacs.  I am sure that the people who
were lucky enough to have EMACS on TOPS-20 were very happy with it.
I know that at some sites it was not allowed due to resources.
But just the four ITS machines alone had tens of thousands of EMACS
users over their lifetime.  There was also the Multics version, 
and the workstations, including the Lisp Machine.  Don't forget all
the assorted "ersatz" Emacs versions on 8-bit and 16-bit micros.
VMS also had several implementations of EMACS (but I am sure it was
restricted at most VMS sites even worse than at TOPS-20 sites).

But in the context of operating system programming features, TOPS-20
had nothing to do with the development of EMACS.  Essentially all of
EMACS was developed on ITS a long time before TENEX was a twinkle in
anyone's eye, although I think there must have been some EMACS
libraries added later by people using TOPS-20.

Today's implementation of EMACS that's popular on Unix and Windows 
is of course a completely different set of code, written in a
different set of languages.  It would be inaccurate to trace it back
to TOPS-20, because it was written by the original guy (who did all
his work on ITS and the Lisp Machine), initially based on code from 
one of the VMS implementations of EMACS, not on the PDP-10 code.

If all you're just trying to say that BBN created a PDP-10 operating
system (TENEX) capable of running EMACS, and DEC finally picked up
those capabilities in their follow-on system (TOPS-20), that's right.
