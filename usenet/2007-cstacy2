If these are the snapshots that were originally put up some time ago,
they were not fully sanitized; Alan had to go back and redact some
more things when people discovered what was there.

I would not put something up unless you are entirely 100% perfectly
sure that it does not contain material that is not supposed to be there.
That has changed several times since it was originally put up, 
because mistakes were made.   The most recent changes that I am
aware of were in the last 12 months.

If you are not the owner of the material, simply saying that you got
it from someone else at some point and thought it was therefore
"okay" is not going to shield you from legal action.

If you have not carefully tracked exactly what was up there,
perhaps you should contact the people who were maintaining it.
It's your responsibility to do this.   It is impossible for
you to contact the people who hold the various rights (which
is not merely Copyright)  - you have no way of knowing who they are.

I recommend caution.
