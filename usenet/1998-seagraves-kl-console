Having difficulties with the emulator and Exec DDT...  I'm currently
trying to make it go.  I used xkleten to compile a SBLK binary of DDT 68,
and then fed it to the emulator.  (I taught it to read SBLK files).
The problem is at TYO3:, where something is going on I don't quite
understand.  Relevant code follows, T=5 and it has the char read from the
console.

TY03:
kl,[
	PUSH P,T
	ANDI T,177
	PUSHJ P,XDTCM
	POP P,T
];kl
	POPJ P,

...  Further down ...

XDTCM:	SETZM DTEFLG	;SEND ARG IN T TO 11, GET RESPONSE IN T
	MOVEM T,DTECMD
	CONO DTE,%DBL11
	SKIPN DTEFLG
	 JRST .-1
	MOVE T,DTEF11
	SETZM DTEFLG
	POPJ P,

What I don't understand is that the character read is being used as the
command for the DTE20.  This could be ANYTHING.  What is the DTE20
supposed to do here?  Or am I reading this different from what it's
supposed to be?
