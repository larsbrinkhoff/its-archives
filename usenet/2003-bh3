That must have been later.  At the time I first created this mini-feature,
I'm pretty sure long mail aliases (long meaning more than six letters)
hadn't been invented yet, and I'm quite sure SYS was where gripes went.

I won't swear to the name GRIPE, though; I may be confusing it with the
WAITS version.  And of course you're right about the colon, but I never
think of that as being part of the name; it's a piece of syntax meaning
"enter monmode briefly"!  (Okay, now I'm trying to remember if monmode
had even been invented in 1965-66, my freshman year, and I'm afraid I
can't decide.)
