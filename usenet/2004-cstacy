Since one hand is already resting on the keyboard, why not?
(You certainly don't need two hands to operate the mouse.)

The Lisp Machine, which was the first commercially available computer
that had a mouse (etc), used a 3-button mouse.  It's keyboard, which was
an extended version of the keyboard for the ITS operating system is where
the modifier keys META, SUPER, and HYPER originated.  (There were also
several other less-commonly used modifiers! You may have seen SUPER etc.
in the X window system which came along a little over a decade later)

On the LispM, you could Control-Meta-Super-Hyper-Right-double-click.
