I don't have any old network host tables conveniently accessible,
but in March 1980 the ARPANET had 50 PDP-10s listed in the Resource Handbook.  
17 TOPS-20, 22 TENEX, 6 TOPS-10, 4 ITS, and 1 WAITS.  
I just now counted them by hand, and those numbers correspond 
to my recollection of surfing around from 1976-1981, and from 
when I was an ARPANET Liaison shortly thereafter.

I don't think the number of TOPS-10 machines went up during 
the period you mentioned -- I am sure it went down.
Maybe you were surfing on the DEC internal net or something,
rather than the ARPANET or Internet?

I thought Mark did mean the ARPANET, but maybe he was referring 
to the decline of TOPS-10 after the TCP/IP transition.

Did any TOPS-10 systems ever make it onto the Internet?
Looking at some email from August 1983, I see a test results of 190 ARPANET
hosts for Internet protocol connectivity, and a bunch are running TOPS-20
and TENEX, but none are running TOPS-10.  I mainly remember when the TCP/IP
cutover happened that I had to convince the DCA to specially allow NCP
access to our ITS machines at MIT, because some important remote users
were stranded on TOPS-10.

None of the PDP-10s on the ARPANET were KS10s.

"Modern" in the offered context appears to mean "more sophisticated
and demanding of resources in certain ways than TECO and COBOL".

Modern applications, programming languages, and editors?
In the late 70s?

Lisp (in several flavors) was the most widely used programming
language in the ARPA research community, especially on PDP-10s.
(The sophistication and power of this language has not yet been
surpassed, although a few of its features have been copied, 
poorly, for other "modern" languages in the last decade.
Lisp is still quite popular today, mostly used for research,
and commercially as a secret competitive advantage.)

There were also many other experimental programming languages
(eg. object-oriented, agent-oriented, formal logics) that people 
used that were implemented on top of Lisp.  Also, very general 
purpose languages like Smalltalk and SAIL were used locally by 
some sites for both research and production purposes.

MACSYMA was a heavily-used mathematical programming system.  
The SPICE VLSI circuit simulator was another widely used program.
And there were many simulation programming systems.
People did a lot of board layouts using SUDS.
For advanced editors, the obvious example was EMACS, but there
were others.  There were also many document preperation systems
(notably, SCRIBE and TeX).  There was also NLS.

That's off the top of my head.

COBOL and BASIC were not used in this community.
But some of the ARPANET sites were at schools, where some of the
students may have used those languages on TOPS-20 (in some cases, 
possibly on the machines that were connected to the network).
