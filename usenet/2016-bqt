I seem to remember that we were experimenting with ITS on it, but 
otherwise TOPS-10. I never saw TENEX on it, but I was not that closely 
involved in the activity, so I really can't say for sure.

I can't remember any KS running ITS at Stacken, but again, there might 
have been some people playing with that as well. By the time KTH stopped 
running their PDP-10s, and Stacken was trying run more machines on their 
own, I was sortof not that active, and there might have been many things 
I don't know about. Stacken had a power problem, though, so "we" never 
ran much on our own. KATIA was, I think, the only large thing that 
Stacken ever really ran. But KATIA was running when Stacken was still on 
the KTH machines as well, as far as I can recall.

And of course, you had Peter, who was running his own tri-SMP KI-10 at 
his own place at the same time (we're talking mid 80s here).
