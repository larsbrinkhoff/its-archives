   My (very fuzzy) recollection of TW's first use of the JFFO had to do
   with identifying which physical disk required service. I believe there
   was a word somewhere where bits represented disks, and a one in a
   corresponding position meant that disk needed attention....

The RH10/RH11 "attention" register contains one bit for each disk unit.
The ITS disk control code certainly uses a JFFO to dispatch on those bits
(I just checked to be sure).  I can't imagine that any PDP10 programmer
would do anything -other- than use a JFFO after she reads that contol
register.
