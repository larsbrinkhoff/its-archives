E10-KL10 132 is now out.  This one has the (hopefully last) fix to the IO
system, more RH10 code (No, it still doesn't work.), some code for the
TM10A (It will become a TM10B when I finally figure out the [CENSORED]
DF10), and other miscellaneous.

This time around, if we start ITS at the GO: point (Skipping the SALV
checks), it gets as far as turning on paging, with only one undefined
instruction along the way.  (It's XCTR).
Paging isn't written yet, so you get a microcode stop. (The emulator will
stop itself.)

Speaking of paging - Does anyone know how KL10 ITS paging works? I have
the microcode and can try figuring it out from that, but if anyone else
knows this already and can explain it, that will save me a lot of time. (I
have no idea how the microcode works.  I tried reading it for some other
reason, and I just confused the hell out of myself.  I bet writing it was 
a real pain in the ass... gate this to that and skip here and so on and
so forth...)

SALV itself doesn't go yet.  The RH10 heavily screwed up.  I have
absolutely no documentation for it, just the source to SALV and the
comments therein. ^_^

Also, the tape stuff uses a soon-to-be-heavily-hacked copy of
tapeio.[c,h], which John Wilson and Eric Smith wrote.  The effect of this
is that tapes from John's tape-manipulation stuff (t10backup, itstar) will
(maybe) be readable to the emulator.  I have to hack up some of the
unimplemented stuff, and get rid of the exit()s in it.  Other than that it
should work mostly out-of-the-tarfile.  Thanks guys.

Other than that, moving right along here.  This is going to be cutting it
incredibly close if I make my deadline! ^_^ (For those who don't know, my
goal is to have an ITS running in time for 2000.)
