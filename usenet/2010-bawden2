Your decision to duplicate the ITS KA10 paging hardware, rather than the
ITS KS10 paging microcode, is spot on.  When I wrote that microcode,
I was painfully constrained by DEC's hardware -- the resulting pager is not
particularly pretty, and I had to make some not-so-pretty changes to ITS as
well.

Yes, the right thing is to re-think the KA10 pager.  Somewhere I've got a
photocopy of short memo by somebody (probably Jack Holloway?) describing
the original ITS paging box, but I can't find it right now, and you've
probably reverse engineered every thing in it by now anyway.  You might
want to make some changes to the format of the 18-bit page table entry.  I
recall that it had a 3 or 4 bit age field (called PMAGEM in the ITS
source), but ITS only ever used a single bit for aging -- so you can
squeeze that down and leave room for more physical address bits.

Did you implement 1-proceed?
