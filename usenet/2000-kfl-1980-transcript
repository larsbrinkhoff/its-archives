No.  The term luser was already current in the early 1980s:

  @O 134
  Trying...
   Open
  MIT A.I. Lab PDP-10
      SYSTEM IS HEAVILY LOADED DAYS AND EVENINGS
  ***TOURISTS: DO NOT LOG IN BETWEEN 9 AM-MIDNIGHT ***

  AI ITS.1168. PWORD 1733.
  TTY 44
  11. LUSERS, FAIR SHARE = 35%

  The capacity of this system is about 15 users.  When there are 24 users
  logged in, as has been true during the day recently, no one gets any work
  done. Please act accordingly.

This was from March 1980.  Luser simply meant user, with the
implication that all users were losers.  A tourist (often spelled
turist) was someone who had no connection with MIT.  We had a T show
up by our name, and we were chased away whenever there were more than
about 15 users on.  There were only 11 here, but only because this was
at about 4 am!

A turist (often spelled lusing turistic scum) who was logged in at the
wrong time was likely to have their account permanently deleted by the
Incredible Flushing Man.  And if you were flushed, it wasn't like you
could just call up another ISP and get a new account.

Jerry Pournelle, the SF author and Byte columnist, had his ITS account
permanently deleted in June 1984 for simply mentioning the net in his
Byte column.

Some golden age.

A friend of mine almost had his account denied because his username,
which was his nickname, sounded like it might be a company.  Ellen
Golden (sp?) was prescient, as DIGEX (Doug Humphrey) did indeed, a
decade later, turn his nickname into a multi-million dollar business.

Two months earlier (January 1980), the SF-LOVERS and HUMAN-NETS lists
were temporarily shut down, as they were bogging down the entire net.
The volume was about a dozen messages per day the size of this one to
about a hundred recipients.  The solution was to go to a digest form,
the first time this had ever been done.

Who?  ITS wasn't copyrighted by anyone.

Maybe it means we need to find a new name for the number between 41
and 43, since 42 has been redefined to mean the same thing as 2.
Lets call it Fred.

I always welcome replies to my e-mail, postings, and web pages, but
unsolicited bulk e-mail sent to thousands of randomly collected
addresses is not acceptable, and I do complain to the spammer's ISP.
