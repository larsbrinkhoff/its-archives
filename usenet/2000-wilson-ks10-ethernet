My understanding is that this was an ongoing/stalled project (by JTW???) when
the ITS machines were shut down, and that it was never finished.

Yep.  CSR, bus address, and byte count.  The NI2010A is the Q-bus version,
it has a fourth register (at 764006) for the bus address extension, if
jumpered for Q22 (otherwise the high 2 bits go in the MSBs of the CSR).

If you're still serious, I have a manual which I can copy for you (keep after
me, I'm really bad about this kind of thing).  Let me know.  It's a pretty
nice interface, it has all the features you realistically need but it's a
lot cleaner than the DEUNA/DELUA.  E11 includes NI1010A/NI2010A emulation
(ASSIGN NI: ...).

The best answer for doing Ethernet on a real live KS10 would probably be
the DELUA (faster and smaller than the DEUNA, and more importantly, it draws
less current), since they're a lot easier to find than the Interlan boards.
I wrote about half of an ITS DELUA driver back when I had a machine running,
but the tape drive broke before that so the only copy I have is the one that
(I hope) is still on my RM80 drive.  So unfortunately I can't read it right
now, maybe some day...  The DEUNA/DELUA is a real pain to emulate though.
