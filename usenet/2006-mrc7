I'm not sure about that.  Although the ITS pager was undoubtably much more 
sophisticated than the KI pager (and KL "hardware", as opposed to 
"microcode" pager), I don't think that it went to the extent of having an 
SPT and CSTs.

ITS virtual memory was certainly less sophisticated than virtual memory in 
Tenex/TOPS-20.  Even RMS admitted that (although he may have forgotten 
that he did so).  What were particularly good/unique in ITS were:
  . generic display terminal support (although maintenance fell by the
    wayside; you have to use CRTSTY for ANSI which is the standard today)
  . PCLSR
  . the .CALL UUO
