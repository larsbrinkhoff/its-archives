If you asking about the responsiveness of the system, the answer 
is that it was optimized for interactive sessions, and included
features for providing real-time response (for doing things like
controlling robot arms). It had job control features and scheduling
features exceeding the capabilities of TOPS-10 or TOPS-20 (or any
other system, actually).  It supported true full dynamic paging 
(and of course page mapping, etc.).  This predated the TENEX pager;
ITS used custom hardware on the KA, and custom microcode on the KL.
User programs could advise the scheduling and the paging system.
It used working sets.  I think that TOPS-20 may have had paging
features that were better. ITS was a very low overhead system, 
and ran much faster than TOPS-10 or TOPS-20,

I'm not sure if that answers your question about "user throughput".

Sometimes that term refers to IO throughput.  Typical users were
doing things like redrawing their screens a lot while using EMACS,
or telnetting or transferring files or email over the ARPANET (or 
over our own local area network which was like Ethernet, but this 
was all prior to the availability of any such commercial technology).
Most terminals were at 9600 baud.  Some users employed the bit-mapped
"TV" terminals, which ran more or less at the speed of the bus.

If you're asking how many punched cards it could read at once,
you're on the wrong planet.
