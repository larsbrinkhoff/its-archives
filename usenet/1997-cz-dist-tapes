I'm getting closer...

This week I finally got the Tops20//ITS dist tapes for my Dec20's. In 
addition, I got a few diag tapes and a pair of rather dusty RM03 packs.

Now, what I really need is some more RM03 packs to use as scratch 
tests//backups. I have a few more at home, but they have interesting things 
on them from my pdp days (Ah yes, RSX11...). So does anyone have any RM03 
packs that I could pick up? Preferably clean...

On a related note, I could use some filters for my RM02/03 drives. Does 
anyone still sell them, or is this going to be a limited resource...

Final question: Does anyone know if the RM80 supported 18bit access? They 
have some more space than a RM02, and do use less current....

Thanks
Chris Zach
