I once had to write a 16 word program to reboot ITS
(MIT's operating system for DEC 36 bit machines)
It had to reside in some bizarre place like locations 20
through 37  (octal),  because 17 was the last AC and 40
was the first location of the UUO handler.

Well,  all I really had to do was load a one block secondary 
boot program,  but what with including a channel program,
and doing an I/O reset and all,...

Well I remember it was the tightest coding I'd ever done.

Not necessarily the best coding,  If you get my drift.

Regards,
    Dave
