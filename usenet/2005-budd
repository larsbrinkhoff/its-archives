I seem to recall the following:

Alan Snyder's C compiler (born on ITS?)

	I used it on TOPS-20, and it was called C20.  Output MIDAS
	which were assembled into STK files, used it's own linker
	(STINKR) written in C.

	supported v6-era C syntax? -- used =+ instead of +=?

	I seem to have (some?) of the sources and binaries on old tape
	images, but the files are on a machine that's off at the moment....

	It may have been his Master's thesis:

		Mentions on DMR's C Hiostory page:
			http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html

		And Portability paper:
			http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/portpap.pdf

		The latter references the Honeywell 6000 compiler,
		so maybe he had it running on both 36-bit machines!

	A 1987 paper lists him at HP Palo Alto Labs.

Utah's port of S.C. Johnson's PCC (PCC20)

	Used this in my latter day TOPS-20 work (until about 1987)
		ported many Berkeley Unix progs, including troff.
		I wrote a "sockets" extension for it's library.

	I seem to have a pcc20.exe and the include files,
	but no sources found, yet...

KCC -- written by Kok Chen, re-worked by KLH.

	Never used it (only available after my TOPS-20 days were over).

	The only sources I've seen, are I think crippled to run under
	MSDOS, compiled by MSVC (used C++ comments), and would not
	compile under "normal" C.

	Contains conditionals for a WIDE variety of systems: TOPS-10,
	TOPS-20, TENEX, Compuserve, WAITS, ITS. Targets include
	KA, KI, KS, extended KL section zero, extended KL non-zero section.

	see
	http://pdp10.nocrew.org/docs/kcc.tar.bz2

	If anyone knows of a complete distribution, please post here!!

Lars' GCC port
