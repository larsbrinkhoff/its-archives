People didn't always think that 9-bit or 12-bit character sets
were unreasonable in the late 60s and mid 70s, either.

ITS supported both the ASCII (7-bit) and the SAIL (12-bit) character sets.
On ITS the extra bits were used as "bucky" bits: CONTROL (not to be
confused with the ASCII formatting characters), META, and TOP.
Those are shift keys on the keyboards for those systems; one program
that you are probably familiar with that used them was called EMACS.
Some more input characters were keys like CALL, BREAK, CLEAR, HELP,
RUBOUT, BACK SPACE, BACK NEXT, and ALTMODE.

Output was a superset of ASCII that included lots of other glyphs,
such as various pointing arrows (up/down/left/right), the Greek 
letters alpha/beta/gamma/delta/epsiol/pi/lambda, infinity, AND, NOT, OR,
sub/superset and union (horseshoes), equivalence, existential/universal quantifers,
greater/less-than-or-equal, not-equal, plus-minus, integral, centered dot,
circle-X, circle-plus, and lozenge (a skinny diamond).

The Lisp Machine (in the 1970s) had a slightly different expanded
character set that handled the above plus some more.

By the 1988 version of the Lisp Machine, characters were occupying 32 bits.
I don't remember how wide they really were (maybe 32), but it was one per word.
(But you could of course store most disk files using just ASCII.)
Machines had 2-8 megawords of RAM: each word was 48 bits (32 bits of data,
8 bits of type-code, 8 bits of ECC).
