ITS (PDP-6 time sharing system at MIT) solved this problem by
automatically dialing up CTSS and setting its clock from the CTSS
clock.  Of course, the machine was only booted about twice a year,
when the hot patches got out of control.  I later made a 60 Hz line
clock which always ran, and served us well for many years except
during rare power outages.
