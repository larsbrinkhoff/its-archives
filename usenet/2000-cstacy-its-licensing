It's a little more complex than that.

In a sense, there is no such single thing as "ITS" or "the ITS
software".  There was never any ITS "distribution" or anything, 
nor was ITS any kind of product, nor (contrary to the silly claims
on this newsgroup) was ITS a deliverable item on a Government contract.  
(And as someone pointed out, that would not automatically make it
public domain or Government property anyway.)  There is no set of
files or directories which can clearly be identified as "ITS";
it's all mixed together with personal stuff.  That means that your
first job would be to determine who holds the copyrights to all the
pieces that you want to make copies of.  That also implies that you
know what the pieces are that you need.

It is very likely that MIT holds the copyrights to everything that is
needed to bring up a running ITS.  However, sorting out what those
pieces are, and distinguishing them from pieces of private materials
(software, documentation, and other files) that MIT might not own, 
and also filtering out other kinds of personal material, is a job
that can really only be accomplished by certain people at MIT.

If you were to take that upon yourself, you would be incurring all
the legal liability that goes with it.  And if you were not personally
intimately involved with the materials at the time, how do you imagine
you would know for sure what you're looking at?  In addition to
copyright issues, you could easily get into other kinds of legal
problems involving areas like invasion of privacy.  There could
potentially hundreds of people involved in legal actions.  
Do you have enough lawyers to back you up on a project like this?

Anyway, there are people working with MIT to create a sanitized ITS
distribution for people who would like this historical artifact.
They are mostly not getting paid, and are doing it for personal reasons. 
This also means that they are not in a big pressured hurry to do it.
When they have something ready, they will also have to get it past the
MIT lawyers, who must be confident that MIT will not get into trouble
by accidently releasing things that they shouldn't.

My advice would be to wait for them to get around to it, and not bug them.
There is no release schedule for this.  It will be a gift when it happens.
