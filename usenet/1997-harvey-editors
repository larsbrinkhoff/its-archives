What still amazes me is how long it took for the TOPS-10 world to get
the message about display editing.  At a DECUS around 1974 I remember
a huge, vociferous argument between the fans of TECO (a non-display version
for the PDP-10, first written at the MIT AI Lab, which had long since
transmuted it into the immediate-mode display-oriented ITS version)
and the fans of SOS (an acronym standing for "son of stopgap," so called
because its original users at the Stanford AI Lab already clearly
understood that display-oriented editing was the way to do, and by the
time of this meeting had replaced it with TVEDIT).  I was amused.

This was also around the same time as the infamous "DEC standard editor"
document, a half-inch-thick book with exactly one page on an optional
display-oriented mode.

[I removed all the other newsgroups because I wouldn't want to say
anything bad about PDP-10 culture except among friends.  :-) ]
