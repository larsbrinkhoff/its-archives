Strip parity, send 7-bit character to the KL's console using secondary
protocol to the DTE (Dec Ten to Eleven interface).

XDTCM:	SETZM DTEFLG	;Clear the "DTE is done" flag
	MOVEM T,DTECMD	;Bits 0-28 are clear, bits 29-35 are char to send
	CONO DTE,%DBL11	;Ring the PDP-11's doorbell
	SKIPN DTEFLG	;Check to see if the PDP-11 has completed the command
	 JRST .-1	;Nope, spin lock
	MOVE T,DTEF11	;Get data the came from the DTE
	SETZM DTEFLG	;This signifies that we have read the DTEF11 word
	POPJ P,

It depends on what software is running in the console PDP-11.  You have just
left the world of PDP-10 hardware and have entered the world of PDP-11
software.  Very little of the DTE20 functionality was defined by hardware.

RXS20F supported "primary protocol" (where all sorts of message could be
sent to and from the -11) and "secondary protocol" (basically just get
a character from the LA36 keyboard, send a character to the LA36 printer,
get/set time-of-day clock).  The latter was compatible with the way that
the KLDCP diagnostics running in the PDP-11 acted as a teletype inteface
for the PDP-10.

		---------------------

When Systems Concepts created their PDP-10 clone, they chose to be
bug-compatible with the KL.  They emulated the DTE20 such that SYSTEM.EXE or
MONITR.EXE could run on their hardware unmodified.

Foonly and XKL decided to add new or different features to their PDP-10
clones.  Emulating a DTE20 is a waste; it is better to have a new console
driver that matches the new hardware.
