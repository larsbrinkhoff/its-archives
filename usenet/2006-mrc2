Time's up.

This was the "@" monitor command, which ran the ATSIGN (or @) program.

@ was a program ported from ITS which read source files and did a cross 
referenced listing.  It recognized PDP-10 assembly and LISP sources. 
Among other things, @ recognized insert operators so it could point to 
which file contained the definition of the symbol as well as the 
references.

Although @ was rarely used with MACRO (since you could use CREF), it was 
quite useful with FAIL and MIDAS sources.
