OK, I'm going to try to help one more time.

I logged onto XKLeTen.PaulAllen.com, an XKL Toad-1 system running Tops-20 which
has the DECUS libraries on-line, and took a look at what was there, using the
PHOTO screen logging tool available under Tops-20:

Things to note:

1. The DECUS program numbers are usually given in octal, so library 156 is also
   #110.

2. The Tops-10 entry is a .SAV file, while the Tops-20 entry is an .EXE file.
   This reflects different internal layouts for the executable file itself
   (zero compression, for example), but nothing about the memory image which
   the file represents.

3. Loading the two versions into memory, they are apparently identical in
   memory usage, making it more likely that they are the same program packaged
   differently.

4. The file CHESS.HOW is identical between the two versions, stating that this
   is a version from TYMSHARE.  "THE DEC TIME-SHARING MONITOR FOR THE PDP-6/10"
   is an early version of what later became known as Tops-10, so it's a port,
   because Project MAC did not run this monitor, preferring the homegrown ITS.

5. RPG is, I believe, Dick Gruen, who was also at the Stanford AI Lab at one
   time.  It wouldn't surprise me at all that RG would give him a copy to bash
   on.

6. The timestamp on the Tops-10 version shows that it is older than the Tops-20
   operating system by about 5 years--and the DECUS people were scrupulous in
   keeping timestamps for historical accuracy.

I can easily make disassemblies of the two available, should you wish to see
for yourself that the code is the same, and that only Tops-10 monitor calls
(i. e., system calls) are used.

I'll even make a bootable Tops-10 disk image for SimH available to you, if you
have someplace I can send 70MB (the approximate size of a bzip2'd RP06 disk
image).
