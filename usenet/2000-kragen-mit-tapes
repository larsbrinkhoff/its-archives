There were a number of tapes that did flake apart as they were being
read (perhaps a magnetic force microscope would have been a better tool
than a tape drive for reading these tapes?), but some of them actually
became more readable after flaking.  Turns out that, in some cases, the
flaking oxide was stuff stuck to the back of the tape --- that had been
peeled off the layer of tape underneath it.

There were several reasons given for the TCFS project in the thesis;
prior patent art is one, historical search is another (Phil Agre wanted
to know when the word "foo" came into use among the hackers), and "I
want my thesis" is a third.

I've heard that, indeed, the self-destruction problem is a problem with
many tapes.  I'd think that, in principle, you could recover 800bpi
data from a pile of 1/8"-diameter metal oxide flakes, but I would
expect it to be difficult in practice.

(Once I scratched the backing off a classified CD-R in the course of
marking it "ruined".  Oops, that was dumb.  Now there's classified data
flakes all over the classified carpet, which unfortunately gets cleaned
with an unclassified vacuum cleaner.  Everyone assured me there was
nothing to worry about --- not least since we declassified a successful
copy of the same CD a few hours later --- but I felt really dumb.)

The power didn't go out on 2000-01-01 either.  :)
