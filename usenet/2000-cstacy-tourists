Daniel,

ITS was indeed very open: all users had what under UNIX would be
called root privileges (at all times).  Also, login did not require
any password, except when connecting from untrusted locations.

As mentioned above, there was a utility program that let you watch
what someone else was seeing on their terminal.  Mere voyerism was 
not the primary use of that facility, though; it was generally used 
to help some user who has having trouble.  It was also useful for
observing someone who was *making* trouble!  Just randomly surfing
around usually turned out rather boring.

There were certainly problems with malicous users, or more often,
users who were just making a mistake.  One poor fellow never lived
down the day he misunderstood a filename wildcard syntax and
accidently deleted almost all the files on the system!

We considered those kinds of problems to be worth the trouble,
compared to dealing with file security issues.  But that doesn't
work in the large.  A better analogy in today's world would be
a file directory in which the Group permissions were set so that
all group member could read/write/delete the files.

ITS was designed for use by a small number of cooperative users living
in a small laboratory.  It was a very advanced PDP-10 operating system
with many interesting features.  ITS was written at MIT (originally
for the PDP-6) and was not based on any other system.  

It was somewhat different from later PDP-10 operating systems such 
as TOPS-10 and TOPS-20.  Many people considered ITS to be better 
than TOPS-20, although "Twenex" had many features (security, batch
processing, extended addressing, uniform application command interface,
and more) which ITS lacked.  ITS was where EMACS, among other things,
was invented.

The ITS computers were run under a policy where we would allow some
limited access by guest users.  We called the guest users "tourists",
and they included students and researchers from MIT and elsewhere
on the network, and even some totally random people who somehow
figured out how to connect to us via the ARPANET.  However, I don't
recall the tourists being referred to in the derogatory manner 
described above, at least by us, even when they were being pests.

The ITS hackers (system programmers) jokingly referred to all the
other users as "lusers"; that didn't have anything to do with tourists.
This joke appears in various places all over the system.
See "LUSER" (or even "USER") in an authentic version of the JARGON file.

Some of the tourists were high school or college kids from the DC area
who had somehow gotten hold of a dialup number to the ARPANET.
Like, their daddy worked for the Defense Department, and they stole
it from him, and then they told a friend who told a friend.
Sometimes these tourists (knowing that at least to some degree,
they were not supposed to be on the system) would try to masquerade
as someone else; the smart ones just kept a low profile.
The DC/VA tourists were generally considered to be the most pesty
and most prone to do annoying things on the system, partly because
there were just more of them.  Anyway, when any particular tourist
became a problem, we would ask them to straighten up, or finally
go ahead and delete their account.  

Starting around late 1981, when people suddenly had access to personal
computers (like the TRS-80) and modems and BBS systems, there were many
more problems with tourist users.   Our open, unprotected environment
was not very compatible with the nascent real world.

Doing something like altering someone else's email would be a good
example of behaviour that would get you kicked off the system.  
That particular thing didn't happen very much -- I don't actually
remember any such incidents off the top of my head.  More likely
would be someone accidently deleting someone else's mailbox.

None of these guest users had any "right" to be on the system; the
whole deal was totally at the sufferage of the ITS administrators,
and so accounts could be terminated anytime for any arbitrary reason.
Typically, accounts were terminated for not obeying the rules about
when you were allowed to be connected (ie. not when the machine is
busy), harassing other users, or for doing things (eg. on the network)
that brought unwanted attention from the Government (you will recall
that the ARPANET was not a public network, but rather a military
network owned and opeated by the Department of Defense).

Not too surprisingly, many tourists had really weird and distorted ideas
about the system, the policies, the people on it, and the whole thing.
