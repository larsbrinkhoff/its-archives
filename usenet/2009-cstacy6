On ITS in the very early days you could send an instant message to user@host, 
and by around 1977 (or perhaps much earlier, I really would have to research
the date) you could do :UNTALK user@host.  UNTALK was a graphical chat program
where you saw each other's keystrokes in real time, with your window on the
top half of the screen and the other user's on the bottom half.
But you did have to know the person's address - the user directory service
(NAME/FINGER) did not hook into the IM service on ITS.

On the other hand, on ITS if you just sent email to "CSTACY" it would
look in the INQUIR database to find out which machine I lived on, and
if I were online at the time I could (if I set the option) receive the
email in real-time on my console.  (There's a whole huge story there
about how such interrupts were handled.)  INQUIR was the user database,
and it was automatically synched all the time (by having the directory
daemons send database updates to each other through email, in fact.)

I don't think I'm describing this stuff in all it's glory; tired.
