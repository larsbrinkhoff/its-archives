If anyone has a copy of those archives, I would suggest being
very careful about the legal implications of releasing them.

MIT sold Symbolics the exclusive rights to that very code.
Afterwards, the U.S. Department of Energy demanded rights to a
derivative work of that very same code.  Various legal battles
ensued to resolve that predicament, and the Macsyma that was
eventually made available under license from DOE was _not_ the
MACLISP version.  It was a subset that had been ported to NIL,
a long dead dialect of Lisp for the VAX.  The "Maxima" program
is yet a third derivative of that, whose rights to GPL are from
an agreement with DOE, deriving from DOE's license with MIT.

The version of Macsyma from Symbolics was eventually rewritten
by them into Common Lisp.  This is not, however, the basis of
the "Maxima" program, which was an independant effort operating
on a different fork of the code.

Also, the ITS version doubtless includes various works that 
are owned by private individual contributors (rather than MIT
or Symbolics, and certainly not DOE).  One should be careful 
to identify the proper owner of each file (which could possibly
conflict with what the copyright notices say).  Just because MIT
or somebody perhaps put an incorrect copyright notice on something
doesn't relieve any later third parties who want to copy those files.

Also, be aware that the name "Macsyma" is trademarked by Symbolics 
(whose assets have been bought by various successor companies,
whose company names include the "Macsyma" or "Symbolics").
I did a little work on it about 9 years ago during the period
it was owned by "Macsyma, Inc.".

To use the MACLISP version of Macsyma, one should seek to secure
a legal agreement license from the current incarnation of Symbolics
(which probably still owns the exclusive license to that code),
and possibly also a second legal agreement from MIT, which has 
entered into licensing contracts with other third parties (ie. DOE).

All that being said, I think it would be really cool if the original
MACSYMA that ran in MACLISP on ITS and TOPS-20 was available for the
PDP-10 emulators.  Perhaps someone will sort out all the legalities.

However, the GPL'd version of MACSYMA, aka MAXIMA, is better than
the original program on the PDP-10, if only for its modern graphics.
MAXIMA is of course written in Common Lisp, not MACLISP.

If you just want a really good version of Macsyma, not having
to do with PDP-10s, you can currently purchase a copy of "Macsyma"
from Symbolics.  It started as the original MACLISP version, then
was ported to Zetalisp (the Lisp Machine), then to ANSI Common Lisp.  
Macsyma runs on Windows, and has lots more features than "Maxima", 
and represents many years of additional commercial development.

I think the most recent incarnation of Symbolics is called 
"New Symbolics Technologies" or something.  They are based
in Northern Virginia. I could dig up the contact information.

ObHistory: The final product from Symbolics was a Lisp Machine
called "Open Genera" that ran in software: a complete emulation
of the Ivory processor chip that powered the workstations.
The emulator only runs on DEC Alphas (that being the fastest
thing around at the time, and the only 64-bit platform, anyway.)
This product is also still available, but you don't need it to
run Macsyma.  Their PC version of Macsyma is much better, 
having had extensive development post-LispM era.
