ITS also had a little bug that ate the characters off the screen (Knight TVs).

I can't find the source code (or even remember the name of the program!) 
right now so I'm not sure who wrote it, but I guess it would have been
in the 1973 timeframe.

This may have been the original bit-eating phage; this was on
one of the earliest bitmapped display systems.
