Feature-wise the ARPANET had everything the Internet has today.
Email, File Transfer, Telnet, Instant Messaging, and even more
sophisticated things on some systems.  All that stuff was around 
by the very early 1970s.  The only difference I can think of is
that the early versions of the web (ca. 1968) never caught on.

For example, Augment/NLS (networked HyperText and more) goes back 
to 1968 and was on the ARPANET in the early years.
See http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/augment.html

For example, the ITS machines had transparent remote file access
with fully atomic (consistent) syscall/IO semantics, over the ARPANET.
(Similar to NFS, but better.)  I don't have the reference materials
handy, but that was around 1977 (maybe earlier). The syntax for a local
file is like "DSK:CSTACY;SOME FILE" but to reference a file over the
network (say, on the AI lab machine) simply say "AI:CSTACY;SOME FILE".
Other devices were also remotely accessible - it was built a generalized
remote device/object protocol running in device-driver userland.

The Internet protocols have brought us a larger network, and the wide
adoption has brought all the social effects and commercialization.
But has there been anything fundamentally new in the last 38 years?
