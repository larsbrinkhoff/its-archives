Yes, I realized that after I sent the reply.  Professor Pratt's
creation, used the TECO available under ITS on MIT's system, and made
use of Control-R mode, which I don't believe was part of "standard" TECO.

And I never heard of TECO being ported to IBM big iron.

Tom Almy has ports of for MS-DOS, OS/2, Windows Console, Linux, and Mac
OS/X at  http://www.almy.us/teco.html.  Almy's versions are based on
Pete Siemsen's TECO-C, compatible with TECO-11 v40.
