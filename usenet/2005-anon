Fine.  It was a typo.

Except it wasn't.  That was what was written down in the stuff I happened to 
have handy about MacHack VI.

But alright.  If it makes you happy, then it was a typo.


> You are confused.  People here have been trying to help

You also missed the not so minor fact the much of the 'confusion' is in an 
area I have repeatedly said I didn't care about and that is not relevant to 
the program.

I don't care about the PDP itself.

I don't even care if Mr. Greenblatt painted his pink and stuck a bra on his. 
That's not relelvant to the program.  (True, it'd be an interesting 
historical story, but not really relevant to the program.)

In the begining, I was told to run it under ITS.

I accepted that as being correct.

So, I hunted down all the stuff, got the recommended pdp-10 emulator, and 
spent a couple days trying to get it to run.

Needless to say, it failed because 1) the program wasn't for ITS, 2) the 
instructions I was given wasn't for ITS.

As for getting TOPS-10 installed and MacHack VI installed under it, I 
haven't been successful there either.  I've been busy with other things and 
haven't had the time to spend on it like I did with the ITS stuff I was 
told.  The quick check I did didn't turn up any quick installation 
instructions like for ITS.

I did play with one image that said it was already set up, but that didn't 
work out.

I haven't asked about more instructions in here about getting the program to 
run.  I haven't been coming back in here and asking more and more questions 
about how to get the program to run, etc.  I figured that when I do get the 
extra time to spend on it, I'd just download the manuals and try to figure 
it out myself.

The majority of stuff in here (esp. lately) has not been at all relevant to 
the program or to my getting the program to run.


Lately, it's all been in areas that I repeatedly said I didn't care and that 
weren't relevant.  pdp hardware stuff.


> people are correcting your mistakes.  Because, if

Actually, you are mistaken.

It doesn't matter in the slightest whether Greenblatt did the pdp-10 or 
pdp-11 version after the original pdp6.

That was part of the latest stuff from pdp fanatics.

He worked on his program for more than 10 years, off and on.  Things did not 
necessarily happen in pdp chronological order.

And some stuff I have on MacHack VI is contradictory (dates wrong, etc.)

And I have no idea which specific version was on those decus tapes.  Other 
than it's for the PDP-10, of course.

*IF* you care about the PDP hardware and its history and so on.

Then no.  It probably isn't a nitpick.

But if you are only interested in the program, then most of those other 
comments are totally worthless and irrelevant.

Most of that stuff just does not matter to the history of the program or to 
whether it would be possible to get, archive, and publish the source for 
MacHack VI.


The reality is many of you are trying to do a history of the PDP etc. that 
simply isn't relevant.

What is relevant are things like:

1) get a pdp-10 emulator.
2) get such and such support tape images.
3) follow the xyz commands to get the OS installed.
4) follow the abc commands to get MacHack VI installed.
5) enter the comand 123 to actually run MacHack VI.

or.

1) I've been in touch with Mr. Greenblatt and he says he's willing to hunt 
for the source.  It'll only be a matter of weeks before we get the tape read 
and the source avialble!


The vast majority of stuff that's been said in here aren't even vaguely 
relevant to any of those things.


I know that many people like the PDP.  Any pdp.  That's not uncommon.  Most 
people from the 50's, 60's or 70's have strong feelings about the first 
computer they used.  Or one they used the most.  Sometimes those feelings 
are highly negative.  Other times they are very fond memories.

But I'm not one of the pdp fans.  I have never used a PDP.  I don't have the 
urge now to use a pdp.  If you were to offer to give me a fully working 
pdp-6/8/10/11/11-780, etc. etc., I wouldn't care.

The closest I care about the pdp itself is in following a sequence of steps 
to get the MacHack VI program running.  The pdp emulator is just an end to 
the means, not the goal itself.  The important part is the program.
