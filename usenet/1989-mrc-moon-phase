A bit exaggerated.

Here's the actual story, albeit from memory; Guy Steele can give the
details:

There was an application that generated source code as output.  In a
header comment the phase of the moon was included.  The problem was
that a maximum possible text width phase of the moon would make the
output line longer than the specified limit.

You guessed it, the output routines would recognize this and output
the overflow on a second line.  The problem was, without any leading
semicolons the overflow was treated as code instead of comments...

This story was told in "The Hacker's Dictionary: A Guide to the World
of Computer Wizards", by Steele et al. (I was one of the "et al"),
published by Harper&Row but (alas!) now out of print.  Unfortunately,
the typographer saw the obvious mistake in the text in the example of
the "phase of the moon bug" and...you guessed it...corrected it.

So, as I said, pointing at the appropriate page: "The example of the
phase of the moon bug bug has a bug.  The bug is that there's no bug.
That's the bug."  :-)
