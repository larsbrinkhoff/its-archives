OK.  Here are the facts with respect to the CALLI system call, operation
41 (also called GETTAB), argument 112,,11:

TOPS-10 implements this system call, a native TOPS-10 system call, in the
kernel.

TOPS-20 implements this system call in the TOPS-10 compatibility package
(PA1050).  PA1050 is loaded automatically when a TOPS-10 system call is
attempted; the machine instructions for the two sets of system calls do
not overlap.  HOWEVER, as a special case check, CALLI 41 argument 112,,11
is implemented by the kernel (routine GETPAT in FORK.MAC or MEXEC.MAC in
older versions) to return the .CNT20 return; and the kernel will return
this without loading PA1050.  This is the only TOPS-10 system call
implemented by the TOPS-20 kernel.

ITS implements this system call in the TOPS-20 compatibility package
(DECUUO).  DECUUO is not loaded automatically, because TOPS-10 and ITS
system calls have an overlap: TOPS-10 CALL overlaps with ITS .IOT, TOPS-10
INIT overlaps with ITS .OPEN, and TOPS-10 CALLI overlaps with ITS .ACCESS.
Fortunately, there are equivalents in the non-overlapping ITS .CALL UUO
for .IOT, .OPEN, and .ACCESS so DECUUO can safely steal these without
impacting its own function.  ITS has no special case check in the kernel's
support code for .ACCESS for this GETTAB.  DECUUO, of course, supports it,
but a program that wants to switch system call suites based upon this will
probably lose on ITS.
