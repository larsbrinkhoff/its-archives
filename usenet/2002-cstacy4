I can't quite decipher your response because it lacks any context.
My question was: in this day and age, for what purpose are people
so interested in CHAOSNET, such that they keep asking about it?

It's historically interesting, but the question comes up regularly 
on comp.lang.lisp and other newsgroups which are not primarily about
footnotes in the history of computing.

By "Getting it right", maybe you are suggesting that CHAOSNET is
superior to what people run on their LAN's today (TCP/IP), or for
inventing some replacement for TCP/IP.  I am not sure there are
many lessons to be learned that would be applicable to designing
today's kind of local area networks.  CHAOSNET's main virtue was
that it was very simple.

CHAOSNET was the local area network protocol invented at the MIT 
AI Lab for the Lisp Machines, back before Ethernet was available.  
It also ran on ITS, of course, and was later ported to Unix, VMS, 
and TOPS-20.  It was made pretty much obsolete when Ethernet became
commercially available and TCP/IP was implemented on the Lisp Machine.

Here's CHAOSNET in a nutshell.
It was a 75 ohm 4 Mbit CSMA cable network.
Packets begin with 48 bits of hardware leader, consisting of the source
and destination address (what today we would call the MAC address),
and a checksum.  There was a simple bridging (routing) protocol.
Packets can be uncontrolled (like UDP) or controlled (like TCP,
delivered in sequence and flow controlled)
The data portion of the packet is up to 252 16-bit words.  
The first 128 bits of the data are the software header.  
CHAOSNET had a flat 16-bit address space (8 bit subnet and 8 bit host).  
It had 16-bit "indexes" which specified the unique port numbers on
each end (the address+index is globally unique on the host).  
Request for connections to services are not by well-known port number,
but by well-known contact name strings (eg. "MAIL").  
A protocol could also receive some initial data in the RFC packet.
Also, instead of opening a connection, lightweight protocols could
be defined to send back a single-packet response (ANS packet).
An RFC could also cause the server to send a redirection packet (FWD).
There were a few other simple packets similar to what ICMP does.
That's about it!   If you get a copy of the AI Lab Memo #628,
you can read about the API and other details.

My personal theory is that people who hear the word "CHAOSNET" have
little idea what it was, but they just think the name sounds cool.

It's called that because of the contrast between a wire network with
packet collisions, versus ARPANET NCP or the token-ring experiments
going on downstairs at the Laboratory for Computer Science, and also
because one of the inventors (or his girlfriend, I forget exactly)
was reading the Roger Zelazny fantasy novels at the time.
