On the Lisp Machine, the "lights" were drawn on the bottom of the
screen, in the form of small horizontal bars that would blink on
when active.  There was one for CPU activity, one for disk activity, 
one for GC activity, and I think another one.   Also down there was
a higher-level status message that told you the state of the current
process (as determined by the scheduling software or alternatively
by the application) - the default run state message was "Run".
There were also progress bars and messages down there that showed 
all network activity, file IO progress, so you could tell what the
machine was doing.  And of course, a clock, and one or two other
useful status thingies related to Lisp.   The low-level run bars
were operated by the microcode - they really were like machine lights.

This was actually just a fancier version of what we had on ITS on the
PDP-10 (with the displays bitmapped into the 10's address space).

The MIT PDP-10s that ran ITS had a "one-proceed" instruction stepping
feature (and some other home-grown custom hardware trapping and
debugging features).  You could access those through normal software,
so users could do even more than one could do from the front panel,
assuming the system was not crashed.  The Lisp Machine also had those.
If the Lisp Machine was totally crashed, there was no front panel, 
but it instead had a debugging bus that you could connect to another
Lisp Machine to do all the front panel things (and more).  Later versions
of the Lisp Machine had front-end processors built in, much like the KL,
so you always had something you could talk to.

Ah, but it's not quite the same was walking over to a KA and using 
the front panel switches and lights to debug and reprogram the machine.  
I always loved using those console switches.  Best ever.
