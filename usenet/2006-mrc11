Yes.  The KI pager sucked.

There's a paper by Greenblatt that made reference to why the KI was 
considered to be a disappointment.

The ITS KAs used Holloway (later Systems Concepts) pagers that were far 
more advanced than the memory map on the KI (and first generation KLs). 
The MC KL had custom microcode (IIRC, the EXTEND instructions were all 
deleted to make space) to implement an ITS pager.

FWIW, Tenex KAs had BBN designed pagers.  I forget the differences between 
the two other than the BBN pager used 512 word pages and the ITS pager 
used 1K pages.

Tenex was made to run on a KI, in spite of the KI pager's inadequacies, 
but most KI Tenex systems ended up being dual processor systems.  Unlike 
TOPS-10, I don't recall Tenex on the KI being noticably faster.
