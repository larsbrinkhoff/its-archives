Hi, Les,

You may recall that I was the guy that came out with that PDP-6
to do the installation.  I brought a copy of project-MAC teco and
did the conversion to the DEC monitor while we were having those
horrible problems of trying to get the machine to pass acceptance
without the air conditioner.  So it was available on the PDP-6
but only in stand-alone MAC-tape when we started, and available
in DEC timesharing when I went home.


By the way, I got to Palo Alto for the first time in a decade
last month.  I drove down Arastradero to see if I could spin by
the old SAIL building (D.C. Power?).  I wanted to point it out to
my lady friend.  It seemed to have been sold off and the gate was
locked.  Ah, well.
