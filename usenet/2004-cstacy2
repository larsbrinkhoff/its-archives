It was not common to use all the modifier keys at once; more common
to use just one or two (such as  Shift, or Control-Meta.)

The ridiculous example I gave can be performed as follows.  
If the mouse is in your right hand, your left is mashed
down on the keyboad just to the left of the Space bar.
Your thumb is on Control, forefinger on Shift, pinkie
on Hyper, ring on Super, middle finger on Meta.

Bear in mind that this keyboard is not quite the same layout as
keyboards today, and was specifically designed for touch-typing 
at applications that used modifier keys (especially Emacs).

Here's a picture of the Symbolics keyboard:

A slightly older version of the Lisp Machine keyboard:

Which was in turn was based on the Knight TV keyboard:
http://world.std.com/~jdostale/kbd/Knight1.jpeg

The Knight keyboard was part of the Knight "TV" system, 
which was the bit-mapped display terminal system for ITS;
this is the origin of Control/Meta commands in Emacs.
(Tom Knight invented this raster scan bitmapped frame-buffer
display system, originally supporting about a dozen or so of
these "TV" consoles at a time in 1972, using the PDP-10/PDP-11 
memory interface that he had invented in 1969).  

The Knight TV system was one of the very first semiconductor memory
bitmapped displays.  SAIL (at Stanford) had something kind of similar 
similar which I don't know much about (having used it for all of 10
minutes, once), but I think theirs may have come came first.
