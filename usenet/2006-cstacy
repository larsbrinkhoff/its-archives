DDT is not extensible and doesn't have a command macro 
definition facility.  You'll have to write a program.
You could write the program in any language -- MIDAS, TECO,
and LISP being the usual ones -- or even as a DDT command script.

M.F.D. (FILE) is (as far as your program is concerned) nothing
more than a file that you can open from which you can read a
depiction of the MFD -- a listing of all the directory names
on the system.  I can't quite figure out what you're asking
about regarding a current directory.   ITS does not have
hierarchical directories, if that's what you're thinking.
(I don't know what you think ">" has to do with anything.)

If you want to write a program to list all the files on the system,
have it open up the MFD as above, loop reading each directory name 
from there, for each directory open up the file ".FILE. (DIR)",
and print out the results.

This is all documented in the OPEN system call documentation.
