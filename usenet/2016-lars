Hello,

Here is an attempt to build ITS from scratch with boot and dump tapes,
and then building as much from source code as possible:

http://github.com/PDP-10/its

The purposes are:

 - To provide an automated build from start to end.  No user invervention
   is necessary.

 - To check whether source code exists for all programs.  Actually,
   we already found a few cases where they don't.

 - To ensure that we know how to build all programs.  In many cases
   just invoke MIDAS, but some require the use of DDT.

 - To update programs with the latest bug fixes and enhancements.

 - To be able to set configurable options across the whole system,
   such as host name, IP address, hardware devices.

The build currently runs on the SIMH and KLH10 emulators.  Of course,
we'd be delighted to test this on a real KS10.

Everyone are welcome to join.
