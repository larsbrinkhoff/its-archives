This had nothing to do with TCP/IP.

The physical host addressing on the original ARPAnet was 8 bits.  This was 
quickly realized to be a mistake, and was expanded to 32-bits within the 
network, although hosts that used the old 8-bit interface would continue 
to work (but couldn't address IMPs higher than IMP 63 or nodes on an IMP 
higher than 3).

I wrote the first 32-bit PDP-10 ARPAnet driver in 1977.  It was my very 
first kernel programming project, strictly unauthorized of course.  When 
Dave Moon heard about my sucess, he did the same for the MIT ITS systems 
and had it running a week later.  It was quite an embarassment for BBN, 
which had claimed that it would take years to upgrade the PDP-10 Tenex 
systems, and tried to deny that I had succeeded (and were even more 
embarassed when my claim was proven true).  BBN was forced to fix Tenex 
post haste.

Now, it took Digital about 5 years after that before it implemented 32-bit 
host addressing in TOPS-20.  Of course, when they did it, they did it 
wrong; but perhaps that was a limitation of their cruddy AN20 hardware.

Digital marketing.

What made this particularly obscene is that the /AN tape files were 
largely unchanged from Tenex (albeit with Digital copyrights), and the 
Tenex AN stuff was open soure.

FWIW, I rewrote most of the AN user mode applications, and my code is what 
Digital ultimately distributed in later versions of TOPS-20AN.  What I 
didn't write, I helped debug.

That may be, but remember that we're talking about the late 1970s and 
early 1980s during the change from DEC to Digital.

DEC bought complete rights to Tenex from BBN, and AN was part of Tenex 
from inception.

The Digital networking strategy was DECnet, and Digital did not want there 
to be any other networking technology.
