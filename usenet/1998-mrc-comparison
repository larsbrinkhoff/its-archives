I doubt it.  All the PDP-10 OSs were fundamentally good, particularly
compared to that abomination called VMS.

Well, I have extensive programming experience on TOPS-10, TOPS-20, ITS,
Tenex, WAITS, and some of the TOPS-10 variants such as CompuServe and CMU.
Excluding Tenex (which was essentially version 0.xxx of TOPS-20), all of
these systems had unique features that made them special compared to all
the others:

TOPS-10		high performance, SMP, support for lots of CPUs (I don't
		think PDP-6 support was flushed until 6 series, and KA
		support wasn't flushed until 7 series) and devices.

TOPS-20		a modern OS even by today's standards, albeit hampered by
		a weak shell and a programming environment that assumes
		that all the world is assembly language.  Better virtual
		memory than any other PDP-10 OS or most modern OSs.

ITS		type-independent dumb terminal support in the kernel,
		albeit limited (the kernel supported two types of
		Datamedias, but no ANSI terminals).  PCLSR (which no
		other OS has).  MLDEV (user mode device drivers).  Great
		hacker playground.

WAITS		most advanced display support of all, not duplicated even
		today.  Last shared code with TOPS-10 in 3.54 days, but
		was extensively hacked even then.  Filesystem and device
		drivers were completely different (most reliable
		filesystem of any PDP-10 OS, the result of the world's
		worst hardware).  Lots of funky devices.
