 Natarajan> (Yeah, I know you were talking about MULTICS EMACS et al.,

Actually, I was talking about the original EMACS, which was 
written for an operating system called ITS, and ran on the PDP-10.

ITS is where most of the development of TECO, LISP, and a bunch 
of other things happened.  It was only used at Project MAC,
and was invented because CTSS was insufficient and Multics
was not yet available and had incompatible design goals anyway.
Commercially available "monitors" weren't even worth mentioning.

TECO was originally written at MIT, and a very ancient vesion
of it at some point escaped to the outside world (along with 
it's originator).  Meanwhile, development of the TECO language 
continued on at MIT, full-blast for about a decade.  The result
was a very powerful version of TECO, in which EMACS was written.

A number of people were principal developers of that version of TECO.
Among them was Richard Stallman, who later went on to start all over
again by writing GNU Emacs (which has nothing to do with TECO).

The version of TECO that is most widely known is the ancient version
that lacks all the features needed to be a full-fledged programming
language -- you could _not_ write a sophisticated program (eg. EMACS)
in it.  It was just a text editor, not a language with which you
could implement a more powerful text editor.

At MIT, we considered our suped-up version of TECO to be the genuine
program (since it was the original program and had been on a continual
development path in the lab there), and we called it simply "TECO".  
The poor-man's TECO that the rest of the world had was referred to 
as "DEC TECO", when it was referred to at all (usually in trying to
clear up some kind of confusion about EMACS).   

I believe the other folks had the corresponding bias, and called 
their losing version of TECO simply "TECO", and called our version 
(when they were aware of it at all) "MIT TECO" or "ITS TECO".

The good TECO was eventually ported to the TOPS-20 operating system so
that people could run EMACS, so some people became familiar with it that way.  
I always forget whether it was also ported to TENEX or TOPS-10.
Someone here will remind me whether TECO EMACS was available on those
operating systems; we didn't have them at Project MAC.  But I suspect
that it might at least been on TENEX, because some of the authors
(mentioned earlier) of some well-known TECO/EMACS libraries were working
occasionally at BBN at the time.  (On the other hand, I also remember
one of them coming back to lab and one day complaining about how awful
it was that they didn't have access to the real thing at BBN.)

A version of DEC TECO was also written for the PDP-11.

You could do all the things in (ITS) TECO that you could do in DEC
TECO, and before EMACS came along, people used raw TECO and other 
TECO libraries (some of which were later incorporated into EMACS).
One EMACS command was escape sequence that would let you enter raw
TECO commands, so you could switch back between EMACS and TECO while
editing.  And of course, the whole point of EMACS is that you can
modify it and customize it and add additional features, all of which
was done in TECO.  Your EMACS init file was, in fact, just a TECO init
file that would be loaded when you started EMACS.  
It would contain things like this:

1:< m(m.mLoad Library)TMACS		!* Maybe load TMACS                !
    m.m^R Select Bufferu:.x()	!* C-X C-B does winning buffer hack!
    m.m^R Just One Spaceu.. 	!* M-Space does Just One Space     !
    m.m^R Draw Vertical Lineu..| >	!* M-| draws vertical line on ITS  !

 Natarajan> but I figured that was as perfect a cue as I could ask for.  ;-)

That link is to a (Lisp) library for GNU Emacs, but what that package
does is implement some version of the poor man's ("DEC") TECO (or some
subset of it, anyway).  This is not by a long shot the TECO language
in which EMACS was implemented in.

I think Natarajan knows this, but, just in case anyone's still confused: 
this library has no bearing on the (earlier mis-stated) history 
of the evolution of EMACS, except as a funny little coda.

With all the possibilities of things like that running around, 
it's no wonder that people could get so confused about the facts.
(But I do think it's weird when they just start making up random
stories and try to pass them off as facts and history.)
