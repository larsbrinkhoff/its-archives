Ken Harrenstein (KLH) poppep up on ITS-LOVERS a few months ago, I
believe. He basically said that he's working to get the rights to
distribute his emulator. He also said that he has recently become a
father. This is most likely the reason we haven't much from him since.

I think it was developed on the Alpha. I guess it will run on most
Unix platforms.

According to KLH, it will be.

DEC^H^H^HCompaq, I believe.
