The "Minnow", which never really saw the light of day because it would
have killed the VAX off was about the size of a VAXstation 3100, had 2 MEG
of memory, 4 Serial I/O ports, and an interface for external disks, tapes,
and networks.

The reasons for its death (and the fact that the KS 10 price was jacked
up by almost $40,000K) was to "protect" the just starting VAX line.

It was done by all the same crew that did the KS 10.  DMCC did the software,
I think.

I think only 2-4 were ever built, and the only OS I ever saw running on it
was ITS.
