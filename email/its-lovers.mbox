     Dammit Ed!  I can't believe you just sent mail to the ENTIRE ITS
     COMMUNITY telling everyone how to create directories!  Now we're going
     to have all the tourists making themselves directories again and we're
     going to have to bring the machine down to salvage them!
   
   I guess it's time to notify CERT so that unsuspecting sites will be able
   to prevent unauthorized intrusion.
   
Maybe we should patch the system so that only users who use $U
(rather than :LOGIN) are allowed to create directories...

     Does anyone have a record of the names and types of all the machines that
     were running ITS at the AI-lab at one time or another?

  The source for ITS starts with the following comment:

    IF1 [ PRINTX \MACHINE NAME = \
    ;WELL-KNOWN MACHINE NAMES ARE:
    ;	AIKA	AI LAB KA10 (R.I.P.)

AI had a PDP-6, on which ITS was originally developed.
I don't think the PDP-6 was ever really connected to the
network and consequently it didn't have a hostname of its own.
It was supplanted by this KA10, which was the MIT-AI machine
in the old Arpanet days.

    ;	MLKA	MATHLAB KA10 (R.I.P.)
    ;	DM	DYNAMIC MODELING KA10 (R.I.P.)

The ML and DM machines belonged to parts of Project MAC,
later the Laboratory of Computer Science (LCS); those
organizations were separate from the AI Lab.  They were
named MIT-ML and MIT-DM on Arpanet.

    ;	MX	The ex-MC KL10

This machine was originally the Macsyma Consortium machine (MIT-MC),
purchased by a consortium of Macsyma users who needed a faster
machine than ML (the KA on which much of Macsyma was developed).
It also became a large nexus of mailing lists, hence its replacement
by:
    ;	MC	Mail Computer KS10

which took over the MC name and mailing services while MX gradually
died.

    ;	AI	AI Lab KS10
    ;	ML	Math Lab KS10

Similarly, these two machines took over for their respective KAs
when the KAs died.

    ;	MD	Mostly Development KS10

This machine was used to support ITS development in the days when
KAs were dying and being replaced by KSs and other, non-ITS hardware.

    ;	SI	Stacken ITS KS10
    ;	FU	Australian KS10
    ;	PM	PandaMonium KS10
    ;	DX	DigeX KS10

These machines had nothing to do with the AI lab.

The DM KA10 was replaced by an orange DECsystem20 named MIT-XX.
It was the object of much derision in its day, as the first non-ITS
machine in the ninth-floor computer room at 545 Tech Square shared
by AI/ML/DM/MC.

There were other PDP-10s at MIT, and others belonging to private
firms like CCA in Tech Square, but they didn't run ITS.

The AI KA-10 had some unique hardware features, like the prototype
paging box that later became the Systems Concepts SC-10, which
was used on ML and DM.  It had a 10/11 interface, which let the
10 access the unibuses of 4 PDP-11s used in the lab (running such
things as the Knight TV terminal service, the XGP Xerox Graphics Printer,
and the Chaosnet gateway), which idea was subsequently adapted by DEC
in the KL architecture.  And it had PC-relative addressing, by
substituting the PC for register 17 when used as an index register.
(I find that I've forgotten whether the JPC (the register that
remembered the location from which the last jump occurred) was an
MIT special or not.)

ML didn't have any particularly special hardware.

DM had the only 9-track tape drive; the other machines had 7-track
tapes, as befit 36-bit machines.  DM was also host to an Evans and
Sutherland display and a bunch of Imlac graphics terminals; it was
the machine that got used for late-night games of Maze.

MC had special "ITS" microcode to emulate the SC pager, and
an interesting bug: if you single-stepped an instruction that
faulted on fetch, it would step once more.

DX was my KS10 machine - I still have the tapes somewhere I think.
It was a KS10, RM03 drives. It never ran at MIT, but at my house in
the Washington DC suburbs (Greenbelt, MD).  

It replaced my KA10, which I had in my apartment in College
Park. The KS10 was smaller, and ate less power, which became 
important when I moved from an apartment (power included) to 
a town house (pay for power yourself).

Now I have an Alpha machine here that I would love to run a 
10 simulator on, and this one of the fine operating systems that
are available for the architecture (ITS would be my first
choice, of course) but it seems that all of the 10 simulators 
are hard to find these days.

Please send me mail if you know where I can find code to make my
fast little alpha, which is completely idle, look like a 10.

Thanks,

Doug

PM still exists.  It's on an RM03 disk pack, and can be booted on either KS10
s/n 4286 or 4664.  My configuration consists of the above-mentioned KS10 CPUs,
a working TU45 on KS4664 and non-working TU45 on KS4286, and two RM03s and two
RM05s dual-ported to both CPUs.  One RM03 has the ITS pack, one RM03 has the
Red (diagnostics) pack, one RM05 has the TOPS-20 pack, and the second RM05 is
a backup TOPS-20 pack.  I also have a TOPS-10 pack on an RM03, but I hardly
ever boot TOPS-10.

Alas, even with $.06/KWH power in Puget Sound, my 2020 systems spend most of
their existance powered off, thanks to the tax-and-spend crowd who have caused
my property taxes to double...there went the dough budgeted to pay the 2020's
electric bill  ;-(

I debugged ITS to the point that the RM03 support code works; unfortunately I
never fixed the bug that it crashes if any RM05 controllers are powered up
(ITS has this distressing tendency to JRST 4, at the slightest provocation).
I'm not sure, but I think that DSKDMP insists upon booting from unit 0 and ITS
also insists upon this...terribly inconvenient in my configuration.

An ITS system without a network is, I fear, not terribly interesting.  It's
truly amazing how much of ITS depends upon the network code and .VALUEs if the
network is absent.  Then too, there were the AI lab TVs, the second best
display system of the 1970s after SAIL's, and all the other neat hardware.

When run as a standalone PC on a text-only screen, it's a lot harder to see
what was so great about ITS.  So many of the great old hacks aren't useful in
that kind of crippled environment.

There's also something to be said for having RMS, MOON, TK, RG, GLS, MINSKY,
PHW, PAPERT, etc. logged in.  ITS was as much the people as it was the
hardware and software.

The one thing that really stands out, though, is what a great programming
environment HACTRN/DDT was.  Damn, I miss DDT!  Even TOPS-20 DDT was so far
ahead of what's available on Unix today it ain't funny.  The only thing that's
ever come close for me was Interlisp-D on Xerox Lisp machines and VisualWorks
(SmallTalk).

I wish that RMS would get off his "rewrite what others wrote so FSF can own
it" religious crusade and produce a functional replacement for HACTRN.  bash?
gdb?  Give me a break...  Then too, I sure wouldn't mind if GNU EMACS would
allow me to enter TECO commands.  There are still some things I can do much
faster in TECO than in anything else...  ;-)

Doug -

You may want to talk with Doug Engelbart .. he is doing some work on
the old SRI-NIC.ARPA machine (now domain mapped as "bootstrap.org").  I
talked to him two years ago and he mentioned they were moving his work off
the KL-10 and onto an Alpha running a -10 emluator (maybe Ken's?) losing
under you know what. 

I may be wrong because I don't remember him saying KLH.

                           And it had PC-relative addressing, by

   (I find that I've forgotten whether the JPC (the register that
   remembered the location from which the last jump occurred) was an
   MIT special or not.)

Ah, how you bring back fond memories!  But I don't remember PC-relative
addressing offhand---was it controlled by a mode bit?

The JPC was indeed an MIT-AI hask, part of the paging box.

   MC had special "ITS" microcode to emulate the SC pager ...

I was the one who wrote that microcode (summer of 1975).
One hundred lousy lines of code and it took me three months
to get it right!  (Well, that included a few small mods to ITS.)
That microcode also supported the JPC, with an improvement:
as I recall, since there were lots of registers sitting around,
it saved that last 16 PC's, not just one.  That came in handy once
or twice.

While I was at it,  I found a way to speed up SOJx by one cycle;
originally it was a cycle slower than AOJx and I found a way to
make them dead even again.  Since SOJx was a heavily-used loop
control instruction group---more used than AOJx, actually---I thought
this might be useful.  DEC decided not to accept the modification
on the grounds that it would be a maintenance headache (it involved
having the central effective-address calculation do some extra work on
the side with otherwise unused functional units, purely for the benefit
of SOJx).

Yes.  I think the index-off-the-PC hack was only in the AI KA10, I don't 
think anyone bothered to add the necessary wires to the ML and DM KA10s.

I am unaware of any software that ever used that feature.

This hack was in all ITS paging boxes.

			     And it had PC-relative addressing, by
     substituting the PC for register 17 when used as an index register.
     (I find that I've forgotten whether the JPC (the register that
     remembered the location from which the last jump occurred) was an
     MIT special or not.)

  Ah, how you bring back fond memories!  But I don't remember PC-relative
  addressing offhand---was it controlled by a mode bit?

My recollection (pretty poor after two decades) is that there was a
flag for this feature (%PCX17?).  I recall writing a program that could
tell the difference between AI, ML, MC and DM based purely on secondary
characteristics like this one.  For example, it could recognize the
different paging boxes by attempting to execute a chain of XCT instructions,
one per page.  On KAs, the translation lookaside buffer had 64 entries and
that was as far as this chain could go.  On MC (the KL), the TLB had 256
entries and therefore it was theoretically possible to make an endless chain,
but I recall that it tended to run out of steam around 190 or so, probably
because interrupt-level activity would claim entries on behalf of the kernel.

  The JPC was indeed an MIT-AI hask, part of the paging box.

     MC had special "ITS" microcode to emulate the SC pager ...

  I was the one who wrote that microcode (summer of 1975).
  One hundred lousy lines of code and it took me three months
  to get it right!  (Well, that included a few small mods to ITS.)
  That microcode also supported the JPC, with an improvement:
  as I recall, since there were lots of registers sitting around,
  it saved that last 16 PC's, not just one.  That came in handy once
  or twice.

  While I was at it,  I found a way to speed up SOJx by one cycle;
  originally it was a cycle slower than AOJx and I found a way to
  make them dead even again.  Since SOJx was a heavily-used loop
  control instruction group---more used than AOJx, actually---I thought
  this might be useful.  DEC decided not to accept the modification
  on the grounds that it would be a maintenance headache (it involved
  having the central effective-address calculation do some extra work on
  the side with otherwise unused functional units, purely for the benefit
  of SOJx).

Yep!  As I recall being told (it was before my time),
one of the neater mods to the PDP-6 was to shave time
off the ever-popular JRST (unconditional jump) instruction,
as follows:

Normally JRST executed into two stages: fetch instruction,
then execute it by copying the effective address into the
program counter.  (I gloss over the treatment of the four
flags in the AC field).

Now, the XCT instruction operated as follows: fetch XCT
instruction, then fetch its operand from memory but fake the
rest of the machine into thinking this was actually an
"instruction fetch cycle".

The speedup to JRST was to share circuitry with XCT so that
JRST became a memory-reference instruction!  Its second
stage became "fetch operand from memory AND fake machine into
thinking this is an instruction fetch AND copy the EA into the PC".
In effect, this eliminated the second stage of JRST, speeding
it up considerably.  Great hack.

But you didn't write the program (did Tom Knight write it?) that ran on 
the AI pdp-6 and could tell in about two seconds whether the lights in 
the computer room were on or off.  It used the behavior of the floating 
point divide instruction.  This only works for fluorescent lights, I 
believe, and only on pdp-6s.

   ...Now I have an Alpha machine here that I would love to run a 
   10 simulator on, and this one of the fine operating systems that
   are available for the architecture (ITS would be my first
   choice, of course) but it seems that all of the 10 simulators 
   are hard to find these days.

   Please send me mail if you know where I can find code to make my
   fast little alpha, which is completely idle, look like a 10.

At Bob Taylor's retirement party a couple of months ago, I heard an
intriguing rumor about a PDP-10 emulator.  The rumor I heard was that
a couple of years ago DEC had licensed a PDP-10 emulator from a third
party for customers who really needed to run some legacy PDP-10 code.

I've only heard about one PDP-10 emulator, and if this was it, that's
why you and I aren't using it to run ITS on our Alphas.  Maybe writing
one is the way to go.  Certainly it'd be a lot easier than writing a
PC emulator, for example, because you have the option of modifying the
operating system if you don't really want to emulate the Morton TTY
controller down to the last idiosyncrasy.  But it'd take time, and in
my case, my employer owns the code I write anyway.

Speaking of hardware mods to ITS machines, I just remembered the CIRC
instruction on the AI KA-10.  It's a 72-bit rotate in which bits coming
out of the high-order end of one AC go into the high-order end of another,
instead of the low-order end, and vice versa.  A CIRC with a count of 36
would put the mirror image of the bits in AC1 into AC2 and vice versa.
That is, bit 3.9 (remember ITS bit numbering?) of one AC would be swapped
with bit 1.1 of the other, 3.8 with 1.2, etc.

This was done for the sheer joy of creation, but it came in handy later
as a quick way to flop bitmap images fed to some piece of hardware
(was it the XGP?) which scanned "the wrong way".

All ITS machines, not just KA-10s and not just the AI KA-10, support 
CIRC.  However the KA-10 implementation is certainly the simplest and 
possibly is the fastest.  If I remember correctly, Guy Steele came up 
with a tricky way to do it 4 bits at a time on the KL-10, but it's still 
not all that fast.

CIRC was also on the KS ITS machines.

I copied (ALAN's?) CIRC microcode to use in the Panda TOPS-20 microcode.  I
also implemented XJRST (yes, even on a KS XJRST can be useful) and DEC's BLTBU
and BLTUB instructions.  These were BLTs between PDP-10 8-bit byte format and
Unibus format, very useful when talking to a KMC11...

What ITS had was software devices. The network file system feature was 
just one software device. (Actually, one software device for each 
remote machine).

When a device name was not recognized, the SYS directories were 
searched for a JOBDEV file with the second name being that of the 
device (Or something like that...). If found, then this was run as a 
separate process. There was a system call API for these software 
devices to get the requests and return the results; essentially, the 
client process's requests were turned into a specialized form of IPC. 
(This is casting it in much more modern terms).

Stay tuned: Someone with access to the SYSCAL documentation will 
probably pull out the details, or even do it from memory.

I wrote a software device which kill processes or process trees on the 
system. The nice thing was that it would also work over the net, 
because the remote-filesystem did something like strip off the first 
two characters of the device name as the machine name, or something 
like that. So you could open this file remotely from another machine, 
and kill a particular job, or a particular person's tree.

The intent was far more utilitarian than hack or prank. Sometimes all 
the telnet ports would be filled up, and you'd need to kill an idle 
tree (possibly your own), but couldn't connect to do so. Or network 
randoms (e.g. guests) would be causing various forms of trouble; it 
could kill their telnet server and make it look like their connection 
dropped, which was often more effective at discouraging certain people 
who would take a more direct action as a challenge.

A log file was kept to discourage frivolous or malicious usage.

This feature was not documented, of course.

As an apparently PDP-10 fan, I wonder if you could help me
answer a question:
	Apparently the ITS operating system had some form of networked file
system similar to NFS. Where can I find out details ?
	Also, did ITS have some form of networked remote command execution
facility, similar to UNIX rsh ? Pointers as to where to find out ?

	Thanks.

To add to rwk's message: unlike NFS, these remote devices implemented the
actual filesystem semantics (e.g. locking worked!) and were as reliable as
local disk.

Of course they weren't connectionless, as this originally predated UDP.

Since this note was originally sent to the tops-20 mailing list I'll also
mention that someone implemented an MLDEV server for twenex, which ran on
XX and I think the late and unlamented OZ.

I believe that there was a cadr client too, but that must have been some
sort of chaosnet device on the ITS side.

The Lisp Machine server was a separate protocol.  As I recall, it 
provided some other services for the lisp machines besides remote file 
system access, but I don't remember what. Implementations existed for 
BSD Unix, Tenex, Twenex, Lispm, and VMS. I did the one on VMS, but I'm 
not sure now whether I did it from scratch or reworked one that HIC 
did.  (HIC did the original Chaosnet software for VMS).

Both protocols predated NFS in implementing filesystem access, rather 
than file transfer semantics.

   The Lisp Machine server was a separate protocol.

"QFILE" -- what FTP should have been.  (*Machine parsable*, not
suggestive-to-humans.  Ever try to get a reliable directory listing
out of a un*x FTP server??  Which was then heuristicated by some web
browser?)

There was some sort of MLDEV implementation written by Stallman for
the "filecomputer."  I don't think this ever received any use.

                                                     As I recall, it 
   provided some other services for the lisp machines besides remote file 
   system access, but I don't remember what.

None.

   not sure now whether I did it from scratch or reworked one that HIC 
   did.  (HIC did the original Chaosnet software for VMS).
   
There was also the successor protocol "NFILE", documented in RFC1037.
I don't think it was ever implemented anywhere but on Bolix machines.

   Since this note was originally sent to the tops-20 mailing list I'll also
   mention that someone implemented an MLDEV server for twenex, which ran on
   XX and I think the late and unlamented OZ.

GZ hacked a mutant version of the MLDEV protocol (dubbed RMTDEV) for
the four MIT Twenex machines.  It was a chaosnet protocol, ITS end was
a JOB device, Twenex server side ran as ANONYMOUS.

It was pretty handy, although not all ITS programs could really use it
properly due to the filename limitations -- anything could get at
XX:SRA;FOO BAR, but only programs that used SOPEN could get at
XX:SRA;ARCHIVES;RISKS-DIGEST;1-APRIL-85 XMAIL.  GZ ended up hacking
TECO to use SOPEN so that EMACS could use it.

operating systems, and one of the systems that played a leading role
on the ARPANET.  See any good book on the prehistory of the Internet.

Guy, how are you ?

I have one question.
I want to know the origin of 'completion' feature.
Emacs has a completion feature to complete the keyboard input
by typing space bar.
DEC VMS had a compeltion feature to complete the command input
by typing ESC key.
As far as I know, TECO has no such feature.
I don't know about ITS or Multics or such early systems.
I guess such completion feature was born in MIT community.

This is the matter I need to consult with your brain.

If you have time to spare and if you know,
please let me know what was the first system to use a completion
feature.

When I started being interested in such things around twenty years ago, I was 
told that something like it originated in the OS developed by Berkeley for the 
SDS 940.  I am just a bit too young to actually know that directly, or to know 
whether my informant was right.

Mention should also be made of Jed Donnelley's RATS system for RISOS, which 
had predictive command completion (no need for ESC, but no penalty for typing 
more than the minimum) in the early '70's.  This feature didn't have a name on 
its own, but when pressed for one he called it the ultimate command 
processor.  The continuation of Unix and DOS shows that perhaps this was not 
so immodest.

Subject: Re: Hello and I want to have your feedback


Control Data Corp had a form of command completion on its operator
consoles for the CDC 6000 series of computers run NOS and KRONOS.  I
believe a PPU did some of the work.

I remember using a pair of binoculars to watch the operator console to
see compile errors in my FORTRAN programs so I could save batch runs,
since we used punched cards, and runs were limited.

The console operators would start to key in commands, and the possible
completions in some cases would appear in a lighter intensity to the
right of what was keyed in, thus giving visual feedback during input.

This was early 70s, so might not predate the tenex stuff, but might be
a pointer worth following. 

Hope this helps.  Thanks for jogging some brain cells long dormant.

Subject: http://its.os.org


I'm behind on my mail and saw the mail about this (just got back from a
few weeks in an IP-less corner of Asia), but I never saw an answer
addressing the original question.  Indeed, pointing a browser at
http://its.os.org gets you the Armenian Youth Federation home page.  The
name "its.os.org" really just points at mc.lcs.mit.edu for the
convenience of anyone trying to ftp ITS stuff (MC is where it's all at) --
I'd guess that no one thought that anyone would try submitting http
requests to it.  In fact, that same machine (MC) was *also* coopted to be
"www.ayf.org", which is why you see the web page there.

A more intelligent httpd on mc that can split the web pages appropriately
might be in order, if it's ever really an issue.

   A more intelligent httpd on mc that can split the web pages appropriately
   might be in order, if it's ever really an issue.

Actually, due to limitations in the HTTP 1.0 protocol, the HTTP server
can't really determine which name was used to reach it.  HTTP 1.1 adds an
option that the browser can use to tell the server what alias was used; I
don't know how many browsers support this new feature yet.  So in the real
world, servers that handle multiple domains have multiple IP addresses
configured, since the server can find out what IP address it was contacted
on.

And those germanium transistors had relatively short lifetimes.  You 
would probably have to have your semiconductor fabrication plant to be 
able to assemble a CPU worth of working boards.

Years ago when I first started using GNUS to read news, I copied a bunch of
stuff from Rob Austein's emacs init file.  I kept the line where he wrote:

  (setq gnus-your-organization "ITS Preservation Society")

(This is the string that GNUS puts in the "Organization: " field in any
news articles you post.)  I felt that this was an organization that I could
really support -- especially when posting to newsgroups.  I have never used
the name of the ITS Preservation Society in any other context.

Today I got a piece of junk US mail at my home addressed to:

the mail was from Microsoft.

Not to mention the job device which gunned down users remotely. (I

What's the problem?  ActiveX makes the BOJ device look good!

Subject: MIT-AI lives again!

Good evening all.

It's been a long time.

Over the weekend, I moved the last of the MIT ITS systems to safety here in  
MD. This system is MIT-AI, the 2020 that fell off the Chaosnet after  
suffering a RP06 disk failure god knows how many years ago.

It's safe now, in my humble abode's computer room. Along with the TU77 and  
a single RM03 (that won't be around for long if I can help it).

So far, I've been cleaning it, reseating the boards, check the fans on the  
PS, that sort of thing. This evening, I finally fired it up, along with the  
RM03 drive. It passed the diagnostics, and the instruction timing tests  
without problems, which is a good sign.

First problem: I can boot TOPS20 (4.0x), but I don't remember for the life  
of me what the password was for OPERATOR. This is off a red pack copy of  
TOPS.

Second problem: I can't find any packs that have ITS on them. Does anyone  
have any of the old ITS packs on RM02/03 media? How about the final ITS  
dumps from AI and MC?

Third problem: I'd like to run ITS on this system, and return it to the  
net. I know the IP stack was never completed properly, but I could probably  
nail a terminal server to the DZ11's, so people could have Internet shell  
access. Then we can start hacking the Chaosnet--IP gateway.

And I mean "we". ITS gave me a turist account many many years ago. I  
haven't forgotten that, and in a way, this is my way of saying thank you to  
the people who helped me. Perhaps others can come, and see the old ITS. Hack  
it for awhile, and remember...

Anyway, the next goal is to get the tape drive running so I can see if  
there is a boot block on any of these tapes. The tape drive is a TU77, and  
needs a LOT of 220 to run. Will have to get an electrician in for that  
project.

Also, I will be researching the replacement of the RM03 with something that  
burns a bit less power. I know that the RM03 was basically a warmed over  
9762 CDC, which was SMD compliant. I think it might be possible to just hook  
the MASSBUSS controller directly up to something like a little Fujitsu  
2312//2322 SMD drive. MUCH MUCH less power, and I could then run the MBA off  
a switcher PS instead of that linear monster.

Anyway, is anyone interested in helping out on this project? It's been  
awhile since I've been on ITS-LOVERS, but please put me back on as well.  
Either this address or cz@silver.lcs.mit.edu (preferred).

Take care

I have/had an alleged RM03 ITS pack but I wouldn't put it on a drive that I
cared about w/o getting it checked first.  I never got my RM03 to work
(needs alignment I think) so I've never tested the pack.  You're local to
I/O Magnetics right?  A few years ago they were willing to do the checkout
for $30-$40, I'll try to dig it up if you want to go that route.

It would probably be a lot easier to build ITS boot tapes on some other
machine with a 9-track drive.  The files to do this are available in
pub/pdp10/its on ftp.dbit.com, see the README there.  If you don't have
another machine with a 9-track drive I can make the tapes for you, or
it can be done on your machine using a microcomputer on the CTY port sending
deposit commands, but that takes forever.

ITS's TCP/IP works reasonably well, it has some flaws and AFAIK the DNS
stuff was never finished.  The hitch is that it expects to talk to an IMP,
not ethernet, since the old DEUNA board drew too much power for the BA11K
to handle on top of the "tape" RH11C they were never used on KSes AFAIK.
These days DELUAs (single board DEUNA replacement) are a dime a dozen and
they draw much less power, I wrote about half of an ITS driver for it but
still haven't finished it (I got started wiring up my KS10s but then also
got started reinsulating the house, ripping the asbestos shingles off,
putting in ductwork for hot air heat, putting in all new windows, writing
a large PDP-11 emulator, and rebuilding the motor in one of my crappy cars
and as yet I haven't actually finished any of these, gotta work on that
problem!).

Wiring is trivially easy, but maybe your area requires being a licensed
electrician to do it (luckily mine doesn't as long as I'm the owner/occupant).
The home center chains all sell twist lock outlets and all kinds of wire.

Sadly no, DEC couldn't leave well enough alone and there are a bunch of
big differences between DEC SMD and real SMD.  According to the docs DEC
reverses the polarity of all the signals on the A cable (easily fixed with a
trick cable since it's differential, but WHY?), they borrow a few pins to make
the sector counter read out all the time, there's a signal to make the sectors
per track switch between 30 and 32 (so you'd need a circuit to count out
sectors either way from the byte clock), and the "unit select" lines are
inputs to the RM adapter rather than outputs to the drive, since the unit
plug tells it what Massbus unit # to answer on.

You could probably build an interface circuit to convert between the two
but while you're at it you might as well use a microcontroller and RAM
cylinder buffer and then hang something cheap like an EIDE or SCSI drive
off the micro, SMD I/O (DEC or normal) is mostly open-loop except for seeks
so the controller assumes the bytes will keep on coming within a cylinder
(i.e. head selection is instantaneous and the byte clock is constant),
but when it issues a seek command it waits for a reply so that's your
chance to dump the cylinder buffer out to disk and fetch all of the new
cylinder into the buf before claiming you're done seeking.

>Anyway, is anyone interested in helping out on this project?

Count me in, also I can supply most spares in case you fry a board and
can't fix it (I see the 8646A is no longer orderable from DEC, too bad
because the KS is full of 'em -- AMD made a part that's off by ONE PIN
but that's no help).

** Comments about SMD and a nice drive table deleted **

This could be helpful. I'll start hacking on a design next week while on  
vacation. Upon further examination, it APPEARS that a RM80 is basically the  
same geometry as a Fuji 2322 drive. Difference being that a 2322 is only an  
8 inch platter, and consumes a lot less power... Not to mention that I have  
2 2322's and 0 RM80's :-)

While on the same target, the MASSBUSS power supplies need some reviewing  
as well. It would appear that the MASSBUSS P/S in the RM03 cabs (and  
probably the 80's and the RM05's) is to put it lightly, a power sucking hog.  
Replacing it with a nice efficient switcher will probably cut the heat  
output of this thing considerably. Any idea how much current the MB adapters  
NEED? Anyone want to spec out a power supply?

In other news, the systems are against the wall, and I've called the  
electrician to put in the 220 volt power lines for the TU77. The system  
boots up nicely off the Red packs (the password is F-S, BTW), and I had a  
fun evening tooling around Tops20 again. It has been awhile... However none  
of my RM03 packs seem to contain ITS, though the tapes are labeled as such.  
Time to get the tape drive going... I wonder if it can sit on the same UB as  
the disk drives. Can't see why not...

Once I get that rolling, we can load the ITS boot tapes and see what's  
there. Question: I might have a copy of the final AI dumps, but who has the  
master set? I seem to remember that there were some issues with people not  
wanting their files up anymore, which is strange because let's face it: ITS  
security wasn't...

Well, wasn't.

Sigh. Times change... What to be done, what to be done?. Perhaps the best  
way would be to load the tapes, and delete the home directories. Then as  
people come back, I could loaed their files or toast them forever, their  
choice. Besides, if I get this thing running on a RM80 clone, I'm going to  
be pressed for space (121 vs 176Mb space)

Anyway there's a lot of other comments and questions that will be popping  
up. Apparently this 20 has a single board MICOM Ethernet card. No sign of an  
IMP11 on this system, perhaps it DID speak chaosnet over the Ethernet card.  
Ifso, there might be hope on getting it to talk to the office Cisco...

Will keep you updated on the status of this project. Thanks for the help so far!

Hmm, I'm almost positive you have ITS on two of those RM03 packs we
loaded into the u-hack last weekend.  (They certainly booted ITS last
time we fired it up, before ftp threw us out...)  Bear in mind that
booting ITS is not completely straightforward; do you have all of the
relevant docs?

If you're talking about the batch of RM03s that Ty and Alan and I
salvaged from the Vermont DOT circa 1989, you should know that every
single one of them (packs and drives) has been declared dead at least
once.  Some of them subsequently returned from the dead for no
apparent reason after being ignored for a while.  If you happen to
have a spare goat, sacrificing it on the CTY at midnight might help.

If memory serves, the MIT KS-10s had three kinds of network
interfaces: ARPANET (BBN-1822 LH/DH via a pair of ACC Unibus boxes,
one of which was a loan and went back to ACC, the other of which went
to Sweden), Real Chaosnet (MIT subnet 6), and an Ethernet card whose
driver never got past the experimental stage.  It's possible that one
of the folks at FTP did some work on the Ethernet driver, but if so I
never heard about it.

Also be warned that by modern standards the ITS TCP code is pretty
seriously lame (fine for its day, but fifteen years is a long time).
You might want to consider writing a SLIP driver, the low line speed
might help keep the TCP from getting into too much trouble....

The disk UB is already maxed out (this is the only UB on which the RM03 was
ever officially supported and the disk RH is set for bus hog mode just to get
that), so you'd get infinite data late errors if the disk and tape ever tried
to run at the same time.  If power consumption is your biggest concern and
you're willing to stand really crummy performance, it might be entertaining
to hack the drivers to allow the disks and tapes to be on the same Massbus.
Massbus has no concept of buffering and disconnects like SCSI does, so this
means disk I/O could grind to a halt for seconds at a time during tape I/O,
but if you're just talking to the machine through the console this means you
could blow off the BA11K entirely.

>Besides, if I get this thing running on a RM80 clone, I'm going to

True, but once you get a generic SMD interface going, hacking ITS for other
geometries shouldn't be too hard so you could put in something huge.

Someone suggested hacking the 8080A code to speak SLIP over the KLINIK
port, this is a great idea since doing SLIP over a DZ port would bring
the KS to its knees instantly and the 8080A has the ability to do DMA
into 10 memory.  I'd be interested in doing the 8080A side of the code if
anyone thinks it's worth it, and I still think it would be a good thing to
add magtape boot code for something a bit easier to keep alive than a TU77,
like a TU80 or TU81.  Too bad they're both so nasty to program (naturally
no bit fiddler either so there would be a lot of software overhead).

No, this'll just make things worse. The major problem with the TCP is that
it doesn't implement modern round-trip-time estimation or congestion
avoidance or slow-start or fast retransmit or fast recovery, and hence is
completely and unacceptably horrid about handling slow paths and network
congestion. Slow links both trigger some of this behavior and make the
results of it worse (to the computer; fast links make it worse for the rest
of the net).

Now, the truth is that all o' this stuff together is probably 50 lines of
C, so you should be able to do it in, um, 20 lines of -10 assembler? The
starting point is to go read RFC2001, and then something that describes the
current RTT estimator and basic congestion avoidance algorithms - Rich
Stevens' books are pretty good, as is Peterson and Davie's networking
textbook.

There are a lot of other things that the IP code could use, but without
these TCP fixes it is simply toast, and antisocial to boot.

Completely coincidentally, one Brad Parker <brad@parker.boston.ma.us> has
just finished porting the unix chaosnet code to some PC unix or other,
which may have some relevance to something here.

Regarding disks and ethernet and so on - I think if it was me I'd be
thinking really hard about either a PCI to Unibus adapter (who knows; might
already exist? - but certainly won't have 18 bit support, so no disks) or a
PCI to main-bus adapter. Aside from making it possible to use $100
controllers, you could use it to solve one of the major problems with
SCSI/IDE by doing the 16->36 bit reformatting in the adapter.

There are lots of 2322 drives around, though more and more are
being sent to the dumpster.  I will see if I can find any around.

Yes, the 2322 was noted a while back to be the right basic
geometry.  It sure will save you on gas too...

   No, this'll just make things worse. The major problem with the TCP is that
   it doesn't implement modern round-trip-time estimation or congestion
   avoidance or slow-start or fast retransmit or fast recovery, and hence is
   completely and unacceptably horrid about handling slow paths and network
   congestion. Slow links both trigger some of this behavior and make the
   results of it worse (to the computer; fast links make it worse for the rest
   of the net).

I was referring to the effect on the rest of the net.

   Now, the truth is that all o' this stuff together is probably 50
   lines of C, so you should be able to do it in, um, 20 lines of -10
   assembler? The starting point is to go read RFC2001, and then
   something that describes the current RTT estimator and basic
   congestion avoidance algorithms - Rich Stevens' books are pretty
   good, as is Peterson and Davie's networking textbook.

Well, as it happens I can confirm that all of this is not a huge
amount of code, because I've added just these things to Epilogue's TCP
code over the years.  I would point out, however, that it took
months/years to understand Epilogue's TCP code well enough to figure
out where to put those 50 lines.  I suspect that the same applies to
the ITS TCP.

I suppose that if nobody else gets to it first I may someday just go
hack the ITS TCP code to deal with this, but don't anybody hold their
breath....

Just for fun, can any of you hackers tell me what this does?

IRPC X,,[RL]
REPEAT 22,[

And then can you suggest a shorter code sequence to do the same thing?

One of my great regrets is that I never managed to own my own PDP10
handbook.  Nonetheless, this seems like a rather arcane way of inverting
register A.  However, without the handbook, I can't recall the single
instruction way of doing this!

Thanks for being the first respondent.

But surely you jest!  "The" single-instruction way???  Here are nine
ways to invert the bits of accumulator A:

	SETCA A,
	SETCAM A,A
	SETCAB A,A		;overkill
	SETCMB A,A		;more overkill
	SETCMM PDL,A		;!! (PDL not used)
	EQVI A,0		;my favorite
	XOR A,[-1]
	TDC A,[-1]
	TSC A,[-1]
	
But I believe that the original puzzle does something a little different.

Silly me.  I read the T!X!CE A,0, as a T!X!CE A,0_.RPCNT.  AOS my answer
and try again..

Btw, I should have realized that web is the source of all knowledge.
For those that have not found it yet, I recommend a visit to

(I tried searching the DEC web sites for "Decsystem-20", "PDP10" and
simply "Processor Reference Manual" and came up with nothing of
interest.  "2060" actually produced some TOPS-20 references from 1989.)

I checked earlier today by calling 1-800-DIGITAL.  The given part number
indeed lists as "DECSYSTEM-10 / DECsystem-20 Processor Reference Manual",
for $85.00, 1.5 week lead time.

Amazing.  I wonder if the 1.5 weeks is to accomodate printing-on-demand,
or just search time in a dusty warehouse.

I still have a box filled with TOPS-20 documentation in the original shrink
wrap.  It's all duplicates of what I have in my TOPS-20 Software Notebooks
(which I will *not* part with; nor will I part with any antique manuals), and
the last of four such boxes that came with my first 2020.

I just checked.  There IS a PDP-10 Processor Reference Manual and a TOPS-20
Release 4 JSYS manual in that box, along with about 30 or so other manuals.

I'd be happy to see it get a good and happy home instead of continuing to
gather dust in my garage.  But if DEC is asking $85 for just the Processor
Reference Manual, I'd hate to give it away to someone who would go and resell
its contents.  So I'd like to ask that I be offered some modest sum plus
shipping...I do have bills to pay...

I believe that the best answer to my little puzzle is:

	AOSN A

And, in response to hundreds of complaints (well, one, anyway) that my
reply to Moon was too obscure,

	BB,C

was intended as a reference to the "Bulls and Cows" game popular 25 years
ago, now much better known as "Mastermind"; matching his suggested answer

	SOSGE

against the pattern

	AOSN A

produces two Bulls and a Cow.

Here is one more puzzle in the same vein:

	HRRZI A+1,44
IRPC X,,[LR]
REPEAT 22,[
	T!X!NE A,1_<21-.RPCNT>
	SOSA A+1
]
TERMIN
	TDCA A+1,A+1
	JRST FOO

and with this I will shut up.

Yeah, I had the order of micro-operations backwards when I said SOSGE.  
Must be getting old!  Just to make sure I fired up my (soft) pdp10 and 
confirmed that you're right.

The new puzzle is JFFO A, FOO, I didn't need to try it on the pdp10 to 
know that.  It's less confusing than the first puzzle.  Clever though.  I 
hope I waited long enough to reply not to spoil it for anyone else.

Subject: Ah the smell of ozone...

Finally I am back from my annual vacation, and ready to dive back into the  
pdp10 world...

This evening I took stock of what I do have, and what I don't. What I do  
have is a working copy of Tops20 4.05 on a RM03 pack. That's the good news.  
What I don't seem to have on any of the RM packs is a copy of ITS.

As my tape drive is still offline (need power. More power), I'm unable to  
load tape images. Does anyone else have access to a drive to cut a RM03 pack  
with ITS on it?

While on the topic, I understand that there has been some discussions  
regarding the final ITS backup tapes. From what I remember, they were up on  
silver for awhile, but some people objected to having their data on a public  
site, and thus they were removed. I would like to get a copy of these tapes  
to restore onto ai here, but I understand that privacy is an issue that  
will have to be discussed in some way if we are ever going to bring this  
back.

It's kind of ironic. The core of ITS was trust. Everyone could see  
everyone's everything. Even randoms from the outside could get in on a  
turist account and rummage around. People say "Well, the net has changed,  
and we can't do that anymore".

I wonder if that's just the problem. That people don't believe... I would  
hope for an open system, that the world could come by and see in it's glory.  
Yeah, some people would crash it. But we have backups, and after awhile,  
that would get old. They would either go on to find something less  
productive to do, or perhaps (like me) they would become entranced by what  
ITS is, and what it represents. Perhaps it would even change them. Ya never  
know.

Regardless, it is an issue, and it is something that needs to be discussed.  
Some people want their files up, others don't care, and others don't.  
Perhaps we could reach a compromise:

One thought: I restore the whole system, and send out a poll to all the  
users I can find.

If they say "Leave everything up", I leave their account.

If they say "Delete my stuff", I delete it

If they say "Keep my account, but delete my stuff", I keep the account and  
delete all in it.

If I can't find them, I delete their files, but keep their account.

Then maybe have a month or two period for all of the old people who exist  
to come in and check things out. Stick it behind a tight firewall for a bit,  
with NT//Unix//Whatever password security to get to the ports. Then  
everyone can come by and see what's there. I still have some of my old files  
from AI (an old net backup from about a year before the boom), but I'm sure  
it will be aa suprise to see what I have in BIGDISK:CZ

Ah well. Thoughts? Comments? I'll save the disk ramblings for another letter...

Subject: bitty MASSBUSS drives

Ok. I'm working on 3 tacks with respect to making a little MASSBUSS:

1)	Build an adapter for SMD drives to hook to an existing MBA
2)	Figure out a way to build a MBA from scratch and nail it to a
	1Gb SCSI drive (small, real small)

3)	Pack it in and find a RM80

Option 3 is probably the simplest, but just not as much fun(tm). Option 2  
might be a possibility, but I'd need a lot more specs on what made MASSBUSS  
tick as a bus, as well as a hack to allow 9 bits of data to be recorded on  
an 8 bit SCSI drive.

Hm....

Another thought: A few years back I remember DEC made a drive called the  
RS08 or something like that. It was a MASSBUS drive that was in a teeny tiny  
box, and was designed to replace RS04 strings. Really small, and had some  
real capacity. Anyone remember what this was, and if it might work on an 18  
bit platform? At this point, one could proibably buy one for less than the  
$10K Digital was asking for it...

Anyway, time for bed.

I may be able to help with this a little, I did a lot of reading up on
Massbus in '92 when my boss briefly got possessed with the idea of having
me design a Massbus-to-SCSI converter too.  But then he decided that if I
didn't think I could get from square one to a working prototype in 3 weeks
it would be a waste of development money -- I sure wasn't going to pretend
I could do that so we scrapped the idea.

The most annoying thing is that it's a very wide, differential bus, so
you need a bazillion drivers and receivers (I think I figured at least
40 chips worth).  As I remember the control bus (used to talk to device
registers) and the data transfer bus (used to send disk/tape data back
and forth) are completely separate, which is why you can still touch the
drive registers while a transfer is going on.  The most annoying thing
about the control bus is that it's asynchronous with a 1.5 usec timeout, 
so you have to be able to turn things around real fast -- I was hoping
to use an 80x86 CPU (cheap, easy to get) to do the RP06 emulation but
my testing showed that a 486DX33 CPU didn't seem to be quite fast enough
to guarantee being able to do the worst case of recomputing the DS register
that has the error summary bit (which is the OR of 48 error bits that
could change at any time) and getting it onto the bus with TRA asserted
before the 1.5 usec is up.  We didn't have a 486DX50 to test on and the
Pentium was only just coming out and cost many hundreds of dollars per
CPU, too much for a little bridge board.  So it looked like we would have
had to use bit slice and it would have been a horrible mess, especially
with me not having built bit slice stuff before.

Things have sure changed now though, a 6x86L/166 is only a little over
$100 and is doubtless vastly, hugely faster than you need for this.
And maybe you're familiar with some more appropriate CPU that has
quick turnaround.  We toyed with the idea of PIC chips for a while
but it didn't look promising.

Anyway here's what I can find from my notes:

Control portion of bus:
RS0-4	5-bit register select
DS0-2	3-bit drive select (together these select a register)
C00-15, CPA  control data bus and parity bit
DEM	demand -- asserted by controller to demand a register I/O cycle
TRA	transfer -- asserted by drive to acknowledge register I/O cycle
CTOD	controller to drive (specifies direction of register I/O cycle)
 misc. signals from controller:
RUN	drive may transfer data while active
INIT	init all drives
FAIL	power fail in progress
 misc. signals from drive:
ATTN	drive wants attention
EXC	exception (parity error)
EBL	end of block (for either disk or tape, drive samples RUN on trailing
	edge of this signal to decide whether to continue -- if the host only
	wanted to transfer a partial block that's its problem, it has to
	eat the extra junk words itself)
OCC	I'm not sure I ever figured this one out, my notes suggest that the
	prints (either RP06 or RH20) called it "ANT DATA COM" and my notes
	describe the pin function as "I'M GONNA PUKE".  That may have meant
	something to me at the time, but...

Register 4 is a special case because it's the attention summary register and
it has a bit for each drive so when R4 is read you ignore the drive select
and drive your bit on the bus for a read (parity is obviously hopeless for
R4), on writes it's write-one-to-clear so you have to check for them writing
a 1 to your bit (or bits if you're emulating more than one drive).

Data transfer portion of bus:
D00-17, DPA  data bus and parity bit
SCLK	sync clock (from drive to indicate when D00-17 are valid)
WR CLK	controller's echo of SCLK while writing, to tell the drive when
	D00-17 are valid

I have cable pinouts for all of this, sorted out from the RP06 prints.

There are a couple of patents on Massbus that might be worth looking up
in case they provide details, I could probably find the patent #s, they're
in the Computer Engineering textbook along with some Massbus timing diagram
sketches (the diagrams cover reading but not writing or maybe it's vice versa,
still pretty helpful).  I think I remember the RM03 manual having some helpful
diagrams and/or pin descriptions, I know which pile that book is in here so I
could look it up if you don't already have it.

Re hacking a SCSI drive for 9-bit data, I vaguely think I remember Len Bosack
saying XKL had found a brand of SCSI disks that supported the 576-byte sectors
you'd need to do this the easy way (I forget, did Macs use this block size
at some point?), but anyway with a little caching I really think just doing
the data conversion in software (well, firmware) won't slow things down much
(only when writing really) and then you don't have to be picky about drives,
which is good because PC crap wears out a lot more often than SMD stuff so
you need to worry about what drives will be available every 2 years from now
til eternity.

I believe you're thinking of the RS06, the RS08 was a 256KW fixed head disk
for the PDP-8.  No idea if it supported 18-bit mode, but the RM06 SCSI
optical deal supposedly could.  It sure seemed to disappear fast though,
and it was really expensive.

If you want to go modern, you might want to try to find an RM06 or RP12,
which, according to scuttlebut, do indeed do 18-bit transfers.  (I'll
believe it when I see it, though.)  At $15k or so, they're not cheap.

There is one funny thing, though: check out the RP12-BC from the list
below.  Does anyone else read this as being a drop-in replacement for an
RM03 HDA, or have I just been stiffing too much MEK in the lab again?

I'd probably go for a low-end i960 or one of IDT's embedded-system MIPS
variants myself - both are good at this sort of thing, and have decent
support tools and embedded-systems prototyping stuff available. Then again,
I am easily swayed by chips with actual registers.

Cc: its-lovers@mc.lcs.mit.edu, void@asylum.sf.ca.us

Just a reminder that this Saturday Alex and I will be hosting Burgerfest V  
at our new home in Relay MD (Just south of Baltimore). This year, we will  
have:

  Food:

Yep, food. We will be firing up the mighty grill again. Even as this is  
being written, shiploads of charcoal are docking in Baltimore harbor.....  
We'll provide the meat and condiments for burgers and hot dogs, as well as a  
few vegetarian dishes. Please bring food to share to add to the bounty :-)

  Entertainment:

The new TV is up and running, and we accept both Laserdiscs and VHS tapes.  
Currently we're looking at the following:

	Twice Upon a Time (Got the LD, excellent)
	Groundhog day (big on elbows lately)
	The Mask//The Shadow
	
And probably a nice high quality porn flick as the evening wears on. Maybe  
we'll get "Behind the Green Door" piped through the stereo. In all it's  
glory (anyone got a subwoofer?)....

  Geek toys:

I have the Dec20s here, what more is needed. Seriously, I'm probably going  
to get a 220 volt extension cord and fire up the TU77 tape drive sometime.  
This will probably be an interesting experiment, but it will also allow us  
to get ITS booted off of tape and finally get a RM03 pack cut. Cool.

  Space

We've got lots of it. 3 levels of house to socialize in.

  Crash space:

For the out of towners, or just sleepy people, we still have some crash  
space availible, along with some sleeping bags. Pls RSVP for crash space, so  
we can get a good head count.

Anyway, on to the details:

Saturday July 26th
4 pm onward

DIRECTIONS

Our Address is:

1007 Francis Ave
Relay MD 21227

Take I-95 to just south of Baltimore.
Take exit 47, Rt. 195 toward Catonsville & BWI airport.
Go west towards Catonsville.
Get over to the right to avoid Park & Ride entrance.
Make a left at t-intersection next to P& R
going south on Rt. 166, Rolling Road.
Rolling rd. will go back over I-95 and transform into Selford Rd.
Make a left at the stop sign (not a four-way stop.) This is Francis Ave.
We are the fourth house on the right, a green cape cod set back from the
road off a steep driveway. We have no on-street parking in front of our
house.

Parking options: you can brave the steep driveway OR go straight at the
stop sign up a block or so and park on Selford Rd. walking back up the
hill to our house. OR you can go a little past our driveway and make a
left onto a new side street and park there.

The house is quite convenient to Amtrack (1 mile away) and BWI airport (2  
miles away). Call ahead and we'll pick you up.

Hope to see you there
CZ and Alex

The saga continues:

This morning I bit the bullet and re-wired my TU77 to run with a 6/20 power  
puug instead of the 6-30 that was on it (from the MIT lab). The drive is  
supposed to ship with a 6-20 anyway, so this was not a problem.

Plugged it into the extension cord, and plugged that into the spare AC  
socket downstairs. Fired up the drive. Blew a breaker. Turned off the  
downstairs AC unit. Fired up the drive.

It loaded.

Loaded one of the ITS dumper tapes (note for pdp11'ers, this tape drive is  
attached to a Decsystem20/20), and fired up the 20. At this time, the room  
temp began to crawl up (I do not have AC in that room). Running a MT command  
from the console would cause the tape to flop around, and finally issue a  
003-xxxx error. This apparently means that the microcode didn't load, and  
thus the system won't run. At least the tape drive logic worked enough to  
move the tape around.

Question 1: Does anyone have a Tops20 diagnostic tape for the KS10 that is  
fully bootable//includes the microcode.

So I began mounting tapes and tried to find one with a boot sector. All  
would seek, then fail. At this time, the room got too hot, and the KS10's  
power supply shut down. I shut everything off, and waited till evening to  
continue.

This evening, it was still in the upper 80's but I fired up the tape drive  
anyway. Started having probelms. The drive would always load the tape and  
come on-line, but now when I try to do a MT, I get a

174xxxx

error. No seeking, no waiting. Fails at once. Any idea what that means? I  
know that the MBA is talking to the drive formatter because I can do a MS  
and tell the system to read tapes in 800 BPI format instead of 1600. When I  
do a MT, the drive DOES switch density to 800, however it still does not do  
any seeks//etc.

So the question is did I screw up the drive by running it in too hot an  
environment? Are there any thermarl breakers in the TU77 that might need to  
be reset?

At least I now have a tape drive. I'm going away to LA for a few days, and  
will work on this more when I get back.

We are trying to clean up and make more room for our Q-Bus equipment.
I have the following surplus equipment, and would like to get rid of
it as soon as possible.  All of this equipment is very large, and a
truck is needed to move it.  I will not ship anything.  Most of the
items are non-functional and need some work to restore them.

TU77 -- I rescued this from a DEC-20 installation that was going away.
I've never powered it up.  It might actually have a chance of working.

RP06 -- I have two of these; one from the above mentioned DEC-20, and
one that John Wilson gave me years ago.  I think the former needs just
a little TLC, and the other needs quite a bit of work.

Kennedy 9000 tape drives -- I have two of these, and a formatter unit,
no interface for the CPU side.  Last time I looked at them, one didn't
work, and the other kept blowing fuses.

9766 -- Heads crashed, perhaps good for parts.

RK06 -- two of them mounted in an 11/60 chassis  (no CPU, no front-panel)
I seem to recall that the positioning mirrors had become detached.

I realize this all may sound like junk; that's why I want to get rid
of it.  If you want anything, let me know quickly, as it won't
stay here much longer.  In the unlikely case that more than one person is
interested, preference will be given to whoever can get it sooner, and
whoever might use it, rather than just look at it.

Please no flames about why I'm not keeping these and "preserving" them.
We're in business to keep 11s running, but one needs to do triage every
once in a while...

Yep, that was me (regarding the TU77). Speaking of which, I seem to remember
that the TU77 and friends all used the same formatter (TM03 if I am not
mistaken). Is it possible to find a TU78 drive, pull out the tape unit, and
stick it in place of the TU77 (with my 18 bit fiddler). How about something 
smaller like a TU80/81?

I doubt it strongly, but did any of the Emulex//Dilog cards ever support the 18
bit MASSBUS--Unibus oddities that made a Dec20 run?

Also, does anyone have a RM80 that they don't need anymore?

Subject: Ethernets and ITS

Good evening all!

Well, the heat wave is finally over, and I can start spending a bit more  
time with the 20 now that I have a chance of keeping the room cool. So far,  
things have been going fairly well. I still have only one boot pack, and my  
TU77 is flunking the diags. Last time I checked, it told me that the problem  
was in the cable//formatter//UBA. Great. Well, I managed to swap the  
cables, and the tape one works on the RM03. So it's either a MBA problem or  
a TM03 formatter problem.

Question: Can I hook the disk drive to the tape MBA and expect the system  
to boot? I know that the tape MASSBUS doesn't do the hog mode DMA, but can  
it run the drive at all?

While waiting for the temp to cool, I've been looking at the ethernet card  
in this box. It's kind of interesting. There are actually 2 cards of merit.

The first is an Interlan BD N11010 S.N. A436. Nice looking single hex width  
card. Anyone recognise it?

This pales though compared to the other card. It's a quad width custom  
card. Completely wire-wrapped with all chips socketed. Someone should go to  
heaven for that... Most of it is SN74XXX gates, interesting board. There are  
3 switches: UBA ADDR 764140, and CHAOS 313011. On the upper right is "WIWS  
MARCH 87*.

What is this? Anyone recognise? It's a really neat hack... Could it be a  
Chaos--IP gatewy card? Doubtfull, since AI never ran on IP, but it is  
interesting. Any software?

Speaking of which, does anyone have any ITS software? It's getting close to  
the time to bring this box on-line, and I'd hate to have to run T20 :-)

Also I still could use a RM80. Any leads would be appreciated. Even just  
the HDA: I can nail it to one of my RH11's.

Thanks!
Chris

Surely that is a Unibus Ethernet adapter.

It's a Chaosnet interface.  If you have a Chaosnet, which you don't, you 
could use it.  Chaosnet was a 4 Mbit/second local area network.

For further information, you could try to get MIT AI memo 638 (if I 
remembered the number correctly, entitled "Chaosnet".)  Last time I was 
at the MIT libraries, their two non-archival copies had been stolen.  If 
you had an ITS, you might find it online in DSK: AMBER; CHAOS ORDER.

No such thing as a Chaos--IP gateway card.  That would be software, not 
hardware.

I think that model # should be "NI1010".  Saw one at Fornax...  Anyway I
kind of vaguely think I remember that 4.2BFD has a driver for it, which is
irrelevant except that if you have no other docs, you might be able to use
the sources to figure out how to program the thing, if you're lucky.  My
understanding is that the good thing about the NI1010 (wrt the KS10) is,
it's a single board and doesn't exceed the max load of the BA11K's PS (when
combined with the tape RH), unlike the DEUNA board set.

    The first is an Interlan BD N11010

As Moon says, an Interlan UNIBUS Ethernet card. I *thought* I had a manual
for them, but I don't - just the Multibus ones (NI3010). If all else fails,
this plus the Unix driver would probably let you figure it out. (Hmm, wonder
if I did a MOS driver for the QBUS version? I have this bit set that I did...)

    This pales though compared to the other card. It's a quad width custom
    card. Completely wire-wrapped with all chips socketed.

Oooh, a CHAOS card, that's a collectors item. Hmm, what do I have I could
trade you for it to add to my collection? (No, I don't want it bad enough to
trade you my KA-10 main console switch panel! :-)

    Doubtfull, since AI never ran on IP

The ITSen did run TCP/IP - KLH did the code. I think it was only ever hooked
up to the IMP driver, though, if memory serves - there was talk of doing a
LAN interface driver for it, especially when the KS's were alive, but I don't
think it ever happened.

    unlike the DEUNA board set.

That interface was a nightmare anyway. Maximum dog barf.

The Interlan was by far&away the best of that generation of Ethernet
interfaces - simple and easy to program. Just had a look at my PDP-11 MOS
driver (in MACRO-11, sorry) - looks like it would be a snap to whip one up
for something else.

PS: Anyone want a driver for a Xerox PARC 3 Mbit Ethernet UNIBUS card? :-)

Right.  AI (the KS) and MC (the KS) were hooked up to the IMPs via ACC
1822 LH-DH adaptors.  At one point JTW was hacking an ethernet IP
driver (which is probably where that Interlan board came from), but
getting the ITS TCP code itself to run over Ethernet in the post-VJ
world would have been a lot of work that nobody had time to do, so it
never happened.

I have a copy of it, somewhere...  wait 'till I get all of my stuff
out of Ron and Margie's basement; I'm fairly sure I put it with GLS's
"Lambda" papers when I cleaned out my apartment at DIGEX.

For a real spin, I could make some photocopies and we could smuggle
them _into_ the library and put them on the shelves where the old ones
used to be.

  At one point JTW was hacking an ethernet IP driver (which is
  probably where that Interlan board came from), but getting the ITS
  TCP code itself to run over Ethernet in the post-VJ world would have
  been a lot of work that nobody had time to do, so it never happened.

I remember looking into IP over Ether for ITS (*).  The thing that
unnerved me the most was that the 14 byte ethernet header would end
giving you an IP and TCP headers which were not word aligned, and the
ITS code expected word alignment.

I didn't remember the congestion collapses happening before the KS'
went away, but they did.  The (SIGCOMM?) VJ paper on Congestion
Avoidance/Control is from 1988 (and it says the first collapse was
1986).  The KS's were still around in May of 1990.

I do recall the lack of DNS support being problematic.  There was a
JOB device based resolver, but I remember being warned away from it.

In their last days the KS machines were marooned, reachable only via
Chaosnet.  I thought the BSD4.2 Chaos code has support for IP over
Chaos, but perhaps the same alignment problem would bite you.

Three files I found when unrolling some 9-track tapes a year or two ago;

	AI:SYSTEM;NI1010 DEFS2
	AI:SYSTEM;KSNET 1
	????/chncp/ch11.h

I this grabbed when I was looking at ITS IP over Ether.  The date I
have is 12/21/89, and the filename appears to have been AI: SYSTEM;

Close.  It seems to be #628, and there's an online copy at
ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/500-999/AIM-628.ps

It's 5MB; it's a bunch of compressed bitmaps of scanned-in pages, and it
looks pretty bad.  I can't tell (from looking at it with ghostview) whether
it would be legible on paper.

Subject: Dead end--Need help with a TM03//TU drive

Ok, it looks like I am at a dead end here...

I've been trying to fix this TU77 tape drive for the past 6 or so months,  
and have run up against a brick wall. Basic symptom is that the RH11  
completely ignores the TM03 controller, and returns a "Data bus parity  
error" when I try to access it.

Now, I THINK the problem isn't as simple as a bad MASSBUS cable, or bad  
ribbon cables in the drive. Reason is this: I hook up a RM80 drive after the  
TU77, and I can address the RM80.

ie:

RH11--------TM03--------RM80--Terminator
              |
	    TU77



Interesting nit: The RM80 can be accessed even when the TU77 has the same  
LUN plug (ie: 0).

Now for the help part: I've been running just the TM03 (with the TU77  
transport turned off) for the past few weeks. I've noticed that if one turns  
off the RM80 HDA, the RH11 controller in the RM80 is not accessible....  
What I NEED is for someone with a TU77, TU45, or even a TU16 to do the  
following:

Turn off the entire TU drive
Unplug the blowers and tape unit. Leave only the TM03 powered up
Turn on the 11, and go to ODT
Check the TM03 registers. See if the system can even see the TM03. See if  
your RH11 gets the CBParity error light when you try to access the TM03  
registers
Let me know what you find.

And help would be appreciated. Also, if anyone knows where I can get my  
hands on ANY service documentation, I would appreciate it.

I wish that TU78's would run on DecSystem 20's.

If you or anyone else wants a second 2065 as a spare, plus the CPU board set
from yet another one, I'm ready to admit that I'll never get a chance to set
mine up.  It's in Troy, NY, near where I-90 and I-87 cross.

That's not necessarily a Y2K problem, if the software that processes file
modification dates is cognizant of the fact that no ITS files existed
before sometime in the 60's or 70's (whenever ITS was born).  It's more of
a Y2060-something problem; until then, yy > 60 can be assumed to be 19yy,
and yy < 60 would be 20yy.

That's true, but then in 62 years someone's going to have to go and fix ITS
again...  ;-)

My email library has a timebomb that will go off in the year 2097.  Of course,
that assumes that the underlying UNIX system will survive the clock going
negative (since most definitions of time_t are signed) in 2038.

Then there's dear TOPS-20, whose clock runs out sometime in the 26th century.

We better fix these bugs now...

Subject: Re: @ ITSY2K

You guys forget that we've had this discussion before.  I -think- it was on
this list, but I'm -certain- that MRC was involved...

Everybody always remembers the silly .RDATE UUO that returns YYMMDD in
sixbit.  But that's not what most ITS programs use to read the time.  Most
programs do all their time hackery using the DATIME library.  DATIME uses
the same format for dates that the file system uses.  In that format the
year, less 1900, is stored in a seven bit field.  So the first date that
will cause us a problem will be 2028.  Fortunately, the two bits to the
left of the seven bit field are not being used for anything, so without too
much work (some byte pointers may have to be fixed), we can keep going
until 2412. [*]

Of course there may be some stupid programs that call .RDATE and parse it
in order to learn the year -- come the millennium, they'll get what they
deserve.

				- Alan

[*] I suppose there may be a glitch in 2156 when the time format first

Not that I can recall.  Then again, one's brain will tend to erode after
innumerable instances of having to explain to people that, golly gee, 2000

What did software use before DATIME was written (in the mid-70s, as I recall)?

DDT uses DATIME.

ATSIGN does not use DATIME, but it uses the RQDATE system call, which
returns the same date format that DATIME uses.  (It also uses the .RDATE uuo
to get the time to print on front of the listing.  I expect that nobody
will object to that.)

I don't know my way around MIDAS very well, but it looks like the only time
MIDAS even thinks about dates and times is when it generates the "random
info block" in SBLK format -- it uses RQDATE to get that.

I've been actively promoting the idea of an ITS Java VM, and a number of 
the investors in the old LMI and Symbolics companies have expressed 
strong interest.  Of course, TECO would need to be updated in order for 
some of the potential hackers to become interested, but nothing comes 
without a price.

If anyone is interesting in porting ITS to the Digital Alpha, let me 
know, it seems worthwhile, and I bet the code for ITS is around here 
somewhere...
Speaking of which, is it licensable from MIT??

Writing a Java VM in PDP-10 assembly would be fun.  But I almost think
you'd do better in a lot of ways by writing a native compiler.  The
PDP-10 architecture already contains all the stack instructions you
need, and the typed pointers would be a breeze to do natively.

The hairiest part IMO would be getting the 10 to do IEEE floating
point.  What a headache.

   No worse than getting an IBM 360 to do it.

Realizing that a goodly number of the world's PDP-10's are now software
simulations, I have to admit that I am ROTFL at the thought of some
32-bit machine with full IEEE floating-point hardware painstakingly
emulating a 36-bit machine that is in turn painstakingly emulating
32-bit IEEE arithmetic.

One could cheat and provide the PDP-10 with a "magic I/O device"
that does IEEE arithmetic, but then the resulting Java implementation
would be hard to port to non-virtual PDP-10s.

Well, you'd have to write drivers for the IEEE: device for these systems,
but maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing.  Someone could breadboard a
card for these systems that has a real IEEE arithmetic chip on it, and
write a version of the IEEE: driver that interfaces to it.  Voila! it's no
longer a virtual I/O device, but a real one.

PDP-10 system programs like the JVM would be are full of checks to see what
kind of processor they're running on.  We just have to be consistent on how
we assign the names (there are still plenty of available K? names).

       I was quoted in a trade journal as saying that PANDA/TOPS-20
       will see the century tick.  What about ITS?  We're going to
       have to do something about that sixbit date format, you know!

   (I intend to continue using ITS into retirement...)

   The SIXBIT date format you are thinking of (from the .RDATE uuo) is for
   simple programs that want the date in MM/DD/YY format.  I presume that on
   January 1, 2000 those programs will want to print the date as 01/01/00, so
   this isn't a problem.

   There are two other date formats.  The .RYEAR uuo returns the year as an
   18-bit quantity, so that will work for quite some time.  The other, more
   common, date format is the one used by the filesystem, and by programs that
   used the DATIME library; this is the format returned by the RQDATE system
   call.  This format packs the year, less 1900, in a 7-bit field, so this
   will last through 2027.  Since the bit to the left of the year field is
   unused, we can easily expand this to last through 2155.

   Probably the most we will have to do is fix a few user programs that have
   the string "19" built into them.

You're right, I had totally forgotten about it, although I remember that
rather sanguine comment that I made that was quoted in the trade journal.
1987 and 1988 were not particularly kind years to me, and I've tended to blot
them out in my mind.

Yup.  I even ran TOPS-20 for a little while with the clock set in the 21st
century to be sure.

My 2020s (I have two working ones, and enough parts to build a third) are
normally not powered up, but I definitely intend for the electrons to flow
through them so they can see the century tick...and laugh as some of the more
"modern" systems in my zoo keep over.

One of them will definitely run TOPS-20.  I might run ITS on the other.
Problem is, all my disks (2 RM03, 2 RM05) are dual-ported, one port to each
CPU).  ITS throws a hissy fit unless its disk is unit 0 and all other drives
are offline.  ;-)

By the way, the ITS that I have is rather crufty.  COMSAT, INQUIR, and some
other stuff would .VALUE right away, lots of links on SYSxxx; to files that
didn't exist, etc.  Was there ever a clean ITS distribution built?

I was pointed here from someone from alt.sys.pdp-10.  If I'm P-Oing
someone or poking where I'm not supposed to, ignore me and let me know.

Anyway, I was trying to figure out how the ITS filesystem worked.  I have
a bent of old DEC things, and especially 36-bit stuff.  I have bits and
pieces of the 1990 AI stuff, just binaries, and some text stuff.  That's
interesting enough...

Having never seen ITS before, this is a little confusing, but curiosity
drives me further :)

I know someone with a KS-10, and we'd love to have ITS on it, but neither
of us could find it.  We already bothered MIT.  I don't think they like
being annoyed about this stuff. 
I almost had a KS, but when they said system, they meant disk packs,
not hardware.  I'd love having one, it'd go nice with my 11/44... :)

Anyway, some nice people and a wizard gave me some starters, but there's
bits and pieces that still don't make sense.  All the FS stuff I know came
from syseng;fsdefs.  I think I'll crock up a module for Linux, then you
can say "mount /dev/whatever -t its"...  This would certainly go over
better than the aborigine man page.

Anyway:

>From the MFD:
MDNUM	Ascending dir # - Do I increment this when I add a directory, or
	is it always zero?

>From the TUT:
QTUTP	Free space pointer to track area.  Advance by cylinders.
	This is supposed to always point at the last available track?
LTIBLK	Bytes mapping the disk start here.
	How do these work?

>From the UFD:

If A is relative location of MFD entry, user dir is located in track numbered
(A-2000+2*MDNUDS)/2	(See QFL2)

A is relative to what?

	UFD DESCRIPTORS:
	0=FREE, 1-UDTKMX = Take next N
	UDTKMX+1 thru UDWPH-1 = Skip N-UDTKMX and take one
	UDTWPH = Write-Place-Holder
	40 bit set = load address.  Lower 5 bits plus next NXLBYT (2)
	chars (17 bits in all)
	40 bit & 20 bit set = "Funny" block if DMDSK.  What is this, anyway?
	End by 0.
	
	What is N?  Which block the file is in?

UDSKMX	# of blocks that can be skipped
	What do they mean by that?

Other stuff:
I'm told it was DSKDMP's job to bring ITS into a running state.  How was
this done?  Did DSKDMP have a loader in the bootblock, or was it on a
paper tape?  (That makes no sense - Did a KS have paper tape?)

I have the file from info; that says how to turn the 9th floor at MIT off.
(That must have been incredibly useful!  Was it just left around, so any
random person could shut things off?)
How was the opposite done - How did ITS come up?

Another thing:  Does the ITS-Lovers mailing list even still exist?
I'm sure sendmail will let me know if it doesn't...

You can safely ignore the DMDSK feature.

It's very important that anyone physically present have the knowledge to 
shut things off safely, when the air conditioning in your building is 
unreliable and letting things get hot, and then get shut off by the 
emergency shut off that kills all power, will create a need for thousands

I don't have it.  I suppose I could ask...
I don't have anything from system;.

Let's see here...  I've got acount, backup, info, sysbin, sysdoc, syseng,
and sys1 - sys3.  (At least that's what I've copied to this machine.  Most
of the ITS stuff I got my hands on is at home.  I think all I didn't copy
was the stuff I wasn't supposed to have - user directories and the like.)

Yeah, that's right, the KL was a bunch of ECL, and ECL + heat = paperweights...

Makes sense.  Besides, I got some interesting useless information from
reading it.

Ask a stupid question...  (I should have phrased that better)

OK - What was the procedure for bringing ITS to a timesharing state?

[ITS and standalone toys belonged in .;]

Ahaha, so THAT'S where they went.  I thought it belonged in SYSTEM;.
So, all I'm missing of KS ITS is . and SYSTEM.  I think the stuff that
went in . (Standalone DSKDMP, NSALV, and DDT) were on dbit, and then if
what I think is the monitor (It's in backup;, and running strings over it
produced interesting monitor-type messages like THE SYSTEM HAS CRASHED, GO
FIND A WIZARD and such.) is actually the monitor, then all I have to do is
find out how they're encoded (I think I have the details on this...), get
ahold of SYSTEM; (Which is where the source lived?  I hope?), make a DUMP
tape, and send it to Ragge.  He has a KS-10 waiting for an O/S.

I had the configuration of his KS on Toad, lesee...
He has an RP06 (broken), a TU45 (Murphy at work, also broken), he has an
RP07 on another machine he can steal, and some DZ11s of unknown number and
such at the moment.  He's leaving for a few weeks, I can get ahold of him
when he gets back.

They're actually pretty similar.  A simple Perl script ought to handle
most of the conversion.  (No, I don't have one.)

Sorry about the slow reply, I was on another planet.

The procedure varied depending on the type of machine.  You're probably 
most interested in the KS10 procedure, but that's the one I remember 
least well.  In general, if starting from a totally cold machine but with 
good disk contents, one loaded a bootstrap from paper tape, magnetic 
tape, or disk depending on the type of machine (using read-in mode on a 
KA) [on a pdp-6 the bootstrap actually had to be keyed in from switches 
in the unlikely event that it had been wiped out of core memory].  The 
bootstrap loaded microcode (if a microcoded machine), then loaded a 
non-timesharing program (DSKDMP on some machines, exec DDT with file 
system capability on others), which could then be used to load an SBLK 
file containing a core image of ITS, SALV, and NTSDDT (exec DDT).  
Starting that program ($G in exec DDT, otherwise just pressing return) 
would run SALV to verify and repair the file system, then start ITS.  If 
one didn't want to run time sharing one went into exec DDT first and 
patched one or two locations to control what should happen when ITS came 
up.  You never start ITS without running SALV first, since it only takes 
a minute or less due to the small, compact, and simple file system (which 
I did NOT write in a weekend or any other length of time).

Traditionally, the name of the file containing the system core image is 
.;@ XXX, where the current value of XXX is written on an 80-column IBM 
punch card kept on or near the system console.

Or did you mean, what do you if you have a new machine with blank disks?  
There was a MAGDMP program which was like DSKDMP but used magnetic tape 
instead of disk.  There presumably used to be before my time the 
equivalent for microtape (DECtape).  Use those programs to load SALV, 
then use SALV's ability to create an empty file system and to restore a 
DUMP tape.  Then use various combinations of MAGDMP, DSKDMP, and NTSDDT 
(depending on the type of machine) to put together the core image needed 
to start ITS and save it to disk.

Or did you mean, what do you do if you have a new type of machine that 
has never run ITS before and want to port ITS to it?  Well, that's a 
longer story.  There's always some kind of screw to be gotten around.

Like the lack of the 4 high bits, and the fact that 80x86 assembly
language stinks?  Combined with the fact that I don't quite know what I'm
doing.

Ahh... this brings up a philosophical puzzle in the nature of a Zen
koan.  What is the essence of ITS, divorced from the 10 architecture?
The elegance of ITS proceeds naturally from the elegance of the PDP-10
architecture; one wonders what elegance could proceed so naturally
from the gross INelegance of the Intel architecture.

I have plenty of docs, both paper and microfiche, and could probably
get occasional time on some real 10s to test code on.

As far as 36-bit math goes, for the first cut the way to go seems to
be to use GCC's 64-bit "long long" type, and mask off the high 28
bits, even though it wastes memory.  After it works, we can see about
more efficient schemes.

> Do the 36-bit parts and I can likely fill in the KA instructions...

Okay.

I've created a new mailing list, e10@cosmic.com (e10 = emulate 10) so
that we don't clutter up its-lovers any further.  Please follow up to
e10 with project discussion.  I've already added you, Daniel; anyone
else wanting to be added should send me mail.

What you need is Alan Bawden's excellent "BUILD DOC" file.  I've got it
around here somewhere.  It takes you step-by-step through the whole process
of bootstrapping a KS10 (using the files I have on ftp.dbit.com to make the
NSALV and DSKDMP tapes, and DUMP tapes of the vital system files for the rest).
I think in the whole file I found only one inaccuracy, and it was something
insignificant like an unpredicted message or something, otherwise the whole
process went exactly as advertised.  The tricky part with the DUMP tapes is
that the supplied ITS 1644 is built with a non-standard address for the tape
RH11, so trying to restore tapes with :DUMP crashes the system (unless you
rejumper your RH), so I did it off-line with TRAN.

If I may be so bold.  As someone who was involved in the switch from ITS 
to TOPS-20 (a.k.a. Twenex) at the AI Lab in the early 80's, I have a few 
observations.

First, a little history. 

I remember having lunch with Dave Moon in the early to mid 80's and 
asking him about whether the AI Lab should run ITS or TOPS-20 on our 
DecSystem 2060, MIT-OZ.  His answer was, that from a technical 
standpoint, either project would require substantial work. He said he 
could not commit too much time because of his committments at Symbolics.  
There was much debate in the lab.  Ultimately, I supported the move to 
TOPS-20 on OZ, and was System Manager for a number of years.

I did so, even though I loved ITS, and the spirit that it embodied.  The 
idea that I could be so intimate as to share someone's files and address 
space as though they were my own.  The idea that :OS and :PRMAIL were 
normal (encouraged) things to do, and that watching Moon write code on 
the TV System monitors was a normal thing to do.  Randoms were a 
nuisance, but the price of paradise.  

I, to this day, wonder what might have been had we made a different 
choice.  Some never forgave me for the position I supported, and though I 
seldom think on those years, I still fondly remember the wonder of 
working MC;  The grace and beauty of the screen handling... :FJOB, 
marty$u (no password), and AI^K!

I am in still in Cambridge, in Central Square, and 15 years have passed, 
and I still think fondly of ITS.  Partially for the system, but more for 
what it let me do.  I use Linux now, and it gives me part of what ITS 
did;  The source code, and a community of people who want to "do the 
right thing".  But I still miss PEEK, and I still want REPLY and FR.  and 
for my screen to know when it's been written on, and where.

This is longer than I intended.  Suffice it to say that I would enjoy 
making ITS happen again on modern, supportable, affordable hardware.

HACTRN (DDT) is an issue, but we all have had to learn new machine code a 
number of times by now, so 64 bits probably won't kill us.

I support ITS on the new machine, this time.  

What do you think, Dave (Moon)?

Marty

Lucky &^*&#(*&#$.  I've yet to see an actual 10 in person...

You'd have less to worry about nowadays, most of the randoms don't even
know how to telnet.

Another reason you're lucky:  I've yet to see actual ITS in action...

Linux is what I've got.  Got me my job.  Lots wouldn't have happened if
Linus didn't change his terminal emulator into an operating system...
Let's just say I'd probably still think Microsoft = Best...

I just want to see it.  I've heard all the stories and seen bits of code,
and I don't understand any of it yet.  But I want to.  Something that
affected so many people in a positive way HAS to be worth learning about.
But the hardware is fast disappearing.  So, while the people who designed
it/used it/made it happen are still here, I'm going to try making ITS live
to see the century tick.  I'll confuse myself with a HACTRN yet!

Oh, you mean an Alpha?  You have an Alpha to abuse?  I meant 80x86...
(Yes, it's backwards.  Yes, it's evil.  I was considering the PDP-11 [I
have an 11/83 under my bed, running 2.9BSD, soon to be a UUCP node...] but
then hardly anyone has one of those, either.  But 80x86es are everywhere.
They're cheap.  And, that's what I've got.)

Don't do it in 80x86 assembly unless you enjoy losing big.  ITS uses
way too many 10-specific artifacts (beyond word size) to work well on
a radically different architecture.  A better route is a PDP-10
emulator written in something reasonably portable like C.

Which brings me to an issue I've been thinking about a lot lately.

I know that there are at least two (probably more) PDP-10 emulators
floating around.  As I understand it, due to heinous copyright
entanglements, none of them is freely redistributable, nor will be in
the near future.  This is a serious bummer -- if PDP-10/ITS/etc. are
going to live on in any way beyond the fond memories of a few, a
decent, freely-distributable emulator seems vital.

Thus, it appears to me that an open PDP-10 emulation project might be
the only way to remedy this problem and ensure the the 10 isn't lost
to future generations of hackers.  I could probably get the ball
rolling by writing some infrastructure and implementing some
non-extended, non-floating point instructions.  I don't pretend that I
could do anywhere near a complete job, but perhaps enough of a start
that others would be inspired to jump in.

Mind you, I hate the idea of duplicating all the effort that has
already gone into writing good PDP-10 emulators.  However, it's been 6
years since the first emulator was announced (by KLH), so I'm starting
to lose confidence that any of the existing emulators are going to
free up anytime soon.  (I'd love to be proved wrong, though!)

Time for crass and crude discussion - progress seldom gets 
made until the ugly stuff is dealt with.

I have no time, and really no internals knowledge to offer
in the porting of ITS - however, due in no small part to the
fact that ITS existed and I managed to be a turist there for 
a long time and watch some skilled hackers, I can help with 
the financial burden.  If we need some hardware (please, no 
intel boxes - a machine that doesn't do context switching in
hardware is not going to win here...) to port to, I will be
happy to provide them.  I have very good contacts in DEC
(or whatever the hell is left of it) and could get a few 
big-honkin-alpha boxes no doubt, or whatever else will help 
make this happen.  Whatever.  This is not the hard part - 
the hard part will be for people writing the code and testing.
My small task can be to lend help where I can, (im)moral support,
etc.

If some group of people is really up to doing it, lets rock.
I would love to see an article on ITS in the trade press as 
the Y2K think slays all of the "modern" systems, and a chance
to :PEEK and :POKE an ITS would be a great thing.

I know I could never PORT ITS to the point that you can load old 10
binaries and go, but I can use the same principles/interface/etc. and
ADAPT ITS to a new architecture.

No, I was told by one of them that he wasn't releasing the emulator
because he didn't want to.  I was going to give writing an emulation a
shot once but the lack of documentation and my lack of knowledge proved
fatal to the project.  I do have some really cool KA-10 era docs (Ads for
the Expandable PDP-10!  Models 1010-1040!) but they're not too mcuh use.
The big kick-in-the-butt was the lack of the high 4 bits, and 36-bit math.

Do the 36-bit parts and I can likely fill in the KA instructions...

Same here!  I like to toy with ITS in it's original form, but if I have to
bastardize it for 80x86, I will.  Maybe if we can get Ragge's KS-10 to
run...

The important thing is that someone have access to the machine.
Alphas will take serial consoles, right?
Then we just plug one into a serial box, dual boot it (UNIX of some sort,
and a blank HDD to toy with) and we can screw with it over the net.
Basically, if the BREAK=halt convention is still followed, nobody would
have to be physically present with the machine.  I've used this bit to
remotely screw with the 11/44.  If it applies to the Alpha as well,
all we gotta do is get some alpha with 2 harddisks in it, and hang it off
someone's termserver.

Sometimes you just have to say "what the fuck".

I have a dedicated 128K net connection and a Class C to hang stuff off of.
I also can help with hardware to some extent, considering that hardware 
is pretty cheap, and I've been hanging around ELI Computers in Cambridge 
for a decade or two, and they are generous.  I'm handy with various 
platforms, and tend to make things work.

I also am just a block from the Central Square T stop, which means I'm 
easy to get to if you don't have a car.  And I have some parking spaces 
if you do.

Anyway, thinking out loud about this, there are some things to work out 
regarding the ITS code;  Not that I think anyone will sue, but I credit a 
lot of the success of Linux to the fact that Linus GPL'ed the kernel.

If he hadn't, there'd always be the lingering suspicion that someone 
would want to go commercial, though the prospects of this are vanishingly 
small in this case.

I would however like to know what MIT thinks about licensing.  I suppose 
if we're doing a rewrite, or something esoteric like putting ITS features 
inside of Linux somehow, that's different.  If it looks and feels like 
ITS in significant ways, then perhaps that's more to the point thank 
doing an interpreted version;  It would be nostalgic, but -- (may I be 
candid? ;-)  I'm less attached to nostalgia where is serves no vaguely 
practical purpose (like giving me an address space large enough to read 
my mail in).  

That is to say, putting features of ITS into GNU/Linux seems like a 
worthy effort;  Sure, there are limits to what is possible, but it sure 
would be nice to have an "ITS Shell" for example, where you could run 
RMAIL, hack, and do send and reply over the internet with like minded 
individuals...  PEEK and
/proc could get to know each other.  There are lots of ITS programs that 
were cool because they "did the right thing" and the OS helped a lot, 
admittedly.

Anyway let's brainstorm...  sounds like some other people are interested 
in thinking about this, too.   I can set up a listserver if the volume 
gets too high or too distracting for purely nostalgic folks.

Thoughts, StUDlY Flames, and even Post X-Day SLACKFUL thoughts welcome... 
 I like thinking about this...

Marty

Why don't you just write a user-level pdp-10 instruction
set and hardware device simulator, and then run ITS
on top of that.  Given that this is a hobby project, 
you'll never finish if you plan on writing anything that runs
in kernel mode.  

An example of what I'm talking about is a system called
Nachos that is used to teach operating systems courses.
It's a program that simulates an operating system.  When it
executes user processes, it actually loads binaries into a
simulated address space, executes them with a MIPS
instruction set simulator, and handles any traps the user
process generates.  You can ftp it from UC Berkeley.

You ought to be able to write this on any random linux 
or windows NT box.

Gah.  I can do better than that if I try.  This is not supposed to be a
quick, easy solution, this will be ITS in as much of it's glory as I can
recover.  We can get ITS to boot and run itself, then handle PDP-10
binaries.

VM/SP did that as well.
I'll go have a look at it.

Yeah, so?  It isn't an operating system if it needs an operating system to
run.  I can take the easy way out any time.  But I'm not going to, that
would be cheating.  That's like Windows 3.1...

I'm sure you could do a lot better.  It would just take a lot
longer.  You could probably do the user-level simulator with
a few weeks of full-time effort.  On the other hand it would 
take you weeks of full time effort just to debug your trap 
handlers if you wanted to port ITS to the bare metal.
I've debugged trap handlers on the Alpha; it's not very

Hm...

As current owner of several 2020's, I look at this thread and say:

		I gotta get these damn things on the air...

				Soon.

So Ok. Who can send me the binaries for more than the bare-metal ITS  
system? FTP em to me at the computer society (ftp.computer.org) in a dd  
format. I have the 9 track SCSI tape drive to cut tapes. I spent most of the  
winter and spring debugging AI's TU77, and it looks like it is FINALLY  
working. What I have now is as follows:

Home:

MIT-AI
	Decsystem 2020
	Loaded to the gunwales with memory
	Ethernet interface
	DZ11 serial interface
	Pair O' MASSBUSS controllers
	
AI's TU77
	Pulls more power than God, but it appears to work
	
A kitbashed RM80 (built from a R80, a RM80 "personality module" an RH11  
controller from a RM03 and a lot of time)

NO RM03's (need one to get this system up)

Back in the old warehouse, I have the following:

	MC (20/20, in better shape than AI)
	LSD (parts)
	Another 20 (operational)
	TU45
	Possibly a pair of RM03's
	Pair of RM02's.

So.... In order to make this happen, I need a few people in the DC//MD//VA  
area to give me a hand some weekend to snag a RM02, and get this thing up  
and rolling. This begs the question:

	Now what?

In order to get on the net, I need a portmaster type controller to  
backwards-connect the DZ11's to something telnetable. Once we have that,  
come on in and hack the Ethernet back to life. IIRC it spoke good chaosnet,  
but not IP per se. If anyone has the code for the chsupdup program that was  
on saffron.lcs, so much the better (chaosnet//IP bridge).

I also need to feed this little box. Despite some slimming down, it's going  
to pull 2Kw/hr at least. Might even be 3 when you factor in the needed AC  
(7*24) and air filters (oh yeah). I wouldn't mind running these monsters in  
the house, but the power bill is definately going to be interesting...

Thoughts? Comments? If we're going to port ITS, we should probably have a  
baseline system up and running. While I like the idea, I wonder if it just  
isn't easier to get a good TOAD-20, load it up with memory//3.5 SCSI, and  
port ITS to that.

That would really help!  Have you got a CPU board set?  I know someone
with the rest of the machine, all it needs is the CPU boards.

Well,  I tried running a PDP-11/44 at high school (THe harddisk died
though) and it ended up pulling 15 amps running.  (28 amps when spinning
up the RA81...)

> A kitbashed RM80 (built from a R80, a RM80 "personality module" an RH11

That's something else I'd have to find, a MASSBUS harddisk...

> NO RM03's (need one to get this system up)

Aren't those the big things that want 3-phase power?  How do you plan on
getting 3-phase?  Here the power company (CILCO) won't even consider
installing it in a resedential area.

Oh, do you mean you have the actual machines that MIT had?

Hmm...  You'll need a Linux box and a multiport card.  IIRC, Portmasters
cost a fortune.  Let's see what's in the junk box at SSI...
I think they had some useless antique 8 or 16 port cards...

I can see AC, but air filters?
We held the 11/44 OK off a (somewhat large, but it was old too) home air
condtioner...  But then again, I've never seen a 10 in person yet, so I
can't really say anything...

I didn't want to raise eyebrows by posting the rest of the archive, since
AFAIK there has been no official decision made about what may be freely
distributed and what may not.  I can't imagine there being any controversy
over the contents of the NSALV and DSKDMP tapes though, and in any case the
tape boot block is not available in the AI/MC dumps (since it was embedded
in the program that wrote it to tape, painful to extract w/o already having
an ITS machine) so it definitely needs to be available somewhere.

He used a really clever encoding so that text files would come out as text
files and everything else would come out as something that's reversible to
36-bit binary using the same rules as for text.  I wrote a couple of really
quick-and-dirty utilities to convert this format back into TM03 format and
add DUMP header records, which worked nicely (wrote lots of tapes using
a combination of AIX and IBM 370 machines, yech, the KS liked them fine
though) but it's really hideous and I'm too embarrassed to release it.
I did a bunch of work converting it all into a less ugly (except for the
weenixism) ITSTAR, gotta finish that and get it into the FTP tree.

With TU77s the really amazing part is the inrush current when you turn it
on.  80A for 5 sec if I remember right...

You're thinking of RP06es, RM03s are perfectly reasonable (for home use)
110VAC disks.

Don't we all wish!!!  Over $100K last I heard.

Maybe, 1 36bit word = 6 SIXBIT bytes, stored in 8 bits and drop the high
two?  That's the easiest way I can think of...

Heh.  I have a 1968 price list which puts a KA-10 at $120,000.
(This is the KA-10 CPU only, no peripherals.  Like buying a Pentium chip.)

Text files aren't SIXBIT, that's mostly used for filenames and symbol tables
and stuff like that (and symbolic system calls I think?  it's been a while).
Text files use 7-bit ASCII, 5 bytes per word packed left-to-right with bit
35 wasted.

>What was the format?

It's a bit complicated, most ASCII characters are passed through as-is but
there's a bit of fiddling to turn <CRLF> into just <LF> and a few other things,
and in some cases the word is just spit out in binary with a little quoting
(I guess the tricky part was deciding when to do this and when not).

>80 amps?  What's that for?  Large motors or something?

My theory was that the TU77 levitates off the floor using electromagnets
and the earth's magnetic field.  But I suspect it has more to do with all
the blowers and the fans for the vacuum columns etc.  I was a bit surprised
to find a heat exchanger in there...

>You'd have to have it on the house mains for it to start without

Nah, my electrical inspector says it's OK to put up to a 150A branch circuit
on a usual 200A main panel.  But the breaker costs over $100 and you have to use
no-kidding-around wire.

Mmm. I may be remembering this wrong but I don't think the ethernet ever
worked on the KS's. My recollection is that they were on the chaosnet with
original (MIT-made wirewrap) chaos boards, and the ethernet card was there
just in case anyone ever developed the energy to a) write a driver and b)
do the vaguely appalling amount of hacking it would have taken to get the

A rather pleasantly crazed individual by the name of Brad Parker
<brad@parker.boston.ma.us> went and ported the chaos code to linux.
(Because he bought an XL1200 and it got lonely without chaos, of course...)

ftp://ftp.parker.boston.ma.us/pub/chaos/

If for some reason you want the original Vax code instead let me know.

Exponential backoff and variance-based retransmission are only about
ten lines of code, total.  It's figuring out where to plug them into a
1980s TCP that's the hard part.

A heat exchanger?  Why would they need that?

For the tape servo motors. They get hot as hell when running full bore, and  
there isn't enough space to air-cool them. So there is plumbing that BLOWS  
air through the motors, then out to a heat exchanger on the back, then back  
to the motors again.

Really cute system. There's a standard "tank" DEC air filter in the circuit  
as well as a 1 way baffle to keep the system at ATM pressure.

Probably ye-old blower motor. However I have my TU on a standard 20 amp 220  
volt feeder (AC type), and it hasn't blown any fuses yet. Nowhere close.

In fact, the only thing on the TU77 that really NEEDS the 220 is the  
compressor motor. It drives 2 compressors: One for the cooling//radiator  
system, and the other is the actual blower motor for the pneumatics.

I have a feeling that a pair of RA81 motors would do just as well. That's  
one of those "down the road" projects to get the TU77 under 1Kw and online  
7*24.

Yep. AI still has the "Carrera" sticker along with the "Intel Inside"  
medallion. BTW: AI has the Chaosnet board, but I don't have the cables.  
Anyone remember the pinout, and have the chaosnet boards for the MicroVaxen?  
Hm. Wonder if Fuzzballs supported Chaosnet...

>I can see AC, but air filters?

Yep. RM03's get very pissed when there's crud in the air. And getting M03  
filters isn't as easy as it used to be.

So a small air filter might be a good idea. Also would catch all the junk  
floating around in this thing.

Hm. I think you're right about this. I must have been thinking about the  
old IMP11's. However AI DOES have a big-assed wirewrap board in it. That's  
the old chaosnet interface. However I do not have the connectors that went  
from Chaos to anything. Anyone remember what the pinouts were? Even better,  
anyone have the Q-bus boards? :-) Whatever happened to saffron anyway?

The MOST painful aspect in my mind was that with an ethernet packet
stored in 8-bit bytes packed into words, after you strip the 14-byte
ethernet header you're left with the IP and TCP headers which are NOT
aligned on word boundaries, which TCP code doesn't want to deal with.

I'll bet however KLH got packets into his KLH10 simulator, they arrived
properly aligned!

So all you need is ISA or PCI chaosnet hardware!

I remember wondering why the AI and MC KS's weren't put on the
internet using IP over Chaosnet; it looked like the code was there on
the VAX side, but perhaps it was another alignment screw.

Are BLTBU/BLTUB not able to fix this?  (Don't have the docs handy.)  The story
I heard was that DEC wrote BLTBU/BLTUB with the idea of supporting the DEUNA
in TOPS-20, before realizing that its current draw was too much to add to
typical BA11Ks (which already have an RH11C, and probably some mix of LP20s,
DZ11s, and/or DUP11s too).  And by the time the DELUA came out (at half the
current draw of the DEUNA) no one cared any more.  Is this at all accurate?

Right.  If you look at your Cisco routers, you'll note that they come
already with code for handling Chaosnet over IP packets.  As well as
PUP (Parc Universal Packets).  Hell, we can probably plug the Altos

Hmm...  *evil grin*  we have a Cisco 2500...There's chaosnet code for
Linux..
My upstream ISP has 2 UNIX-gods with a liking for bizarre protocols and a

What's the chances of tunneling Chaosnet over Internet?  :)

In my opinion this type of romantic fantasy is extremely admirable, but 
almost always is equally impractical.  I wish you all good luck, but I'll 
be surprised if you get anywhere, either on an emulator or on a new 
ITS-flavored system for the next millenium.  It takes a hell of a lot of 
sitzfleisch to actually pull off something like that.  If you've got that 
energy you probably also have the imagination to think of more beneficial 
places to apply it.  This from someone who wrote an SDS-930 emulator in 
microcode once, but I was younger then and got paid to do it.

One comment: lack of precise documentation is not a problem with the 
pdp-10 architecture.  Finding those old books will be the easiest part of 
the job.  I haven't thrown away any of mine.

For myself, I prefer my time-enhanced golden memories of ITS the way I 
remember it, over being brought down to earth by confrontation with the 
less than perfect reality of what it actually was.  I suppose that's why 
I haven't booted my copy of ITS in six months.  The technology I use in 
my work now sucks, but I'm not emotionally attached to it so I don't let 
that bother me, and at least I haven't seen flames come out of the disk 
controller on the HP PC I use yet.

Sigh.  Truer and sadder words have not been spoken.

This is from someone who has two working 2020 systems with TOPS-20, TOPS-10,
and ITS boot packs; helped KLH debug his emulator; ported the KLH emulator to
the NeXT and the Mac; and still has TOPS-20 ready to boot on his ancient Mac
Powerbook.

In spite of having been crazy enough to put in all that energy (and money!), I
too have been confronted with the need to put it in more beneficial places.  I
rarely use the Mac any more, much less boot TOPS-20 on it.  I rarely power up
the 2020s either; partially for budget reasons, but also to conserve these
fine old machines and especially their fragile disk drives.

The one exception to this is how, precisely, the pager works.

I absolutely agree with this.  ITS (and, sad to say, TOPS-20) had some severe
limitations that make it difficult if not impossible to do serious work on
either today.

I believe that this is correct - we were going to take a

connection to serial ports to allow people to telnet in...

work that we have to get done - I have a number of better tools
to get real work done, but I might be very happy to have a mail

there, and maybe try to make CRTSTY understand HTML (that is a

For this reason, a certain amount of resources might be a good thing
to put in.  ITS/tops are far better pieces of performance art if
they are on the net where people can be turists - think of the internet
as the thing that evolved so that everyone everywhere can tap into 
these important generations of operating systems....

Doesn't xkleten.paulallen.com serve that purpose for TOPS-20?

FWIW, I think that Pine can definitely be ported to TOPS-20, but probably not
ITS.  A lot of the background work has already been done.

Agreed, but they (especially ITS) lived in a much kinder and gentler world
than today; a world in which a benevolent military dictatorship (as hard as it
is to swallow such a concept, DCA and DARPA really were just that) made it
possible for us to have windows and even leave the doors unlocked.

That world is gone forever.

Yes, I am sure that it does.  I have been meaning to get an account
over there.

This bring up another question - can we just get another 2 TOADs
and then work on getting ITS and tops-10 to run on them?  Yes, I
know they cost some money, but how rough a technical job would it
be, given that you would have a KL10 (modulo some things) under
you in hardware, running modern disks, etc?

Well, yes and no.  I would have no problem putting an ITS on the 
net with panda running - and knowing that we had automated backup
running each night, and a completely automated restoral process so
that if someone got in a scribbled bad things on the machien they 
would just get hosed off each night.  Remember, while there are now
millions of "hacker kids" out there running nasty-scripts, they 
wouldn't know what to do with an ITS machine - it can't mail-relay, 
it doesn't grok the web, what good is it?  ;-)

As to DoD funding, that burden can shift to people who have made
money on the net.  Paul Allen is helping with the 20 site.  Some 
of us who have maid less than a millionth of what Paul has made 
might be able to let the machine sit in our computer rooms where
power and cooling are not a problem, and we have a couple of T3
lines coming in...  no problem.  Maybe the XKL people would look 
kindly on the effort and give a good discount to us so that we can 
buy the machines that we need....

In a purely rational world you are correct.

For utterly irrational and idealistic reasons, I feel that there ought
to be a freely distributable PDP-10 emulator.  I want as many hackers
as possible to have the opportunity to be inspired by the elegance of
the PDP-10 architecture, as I was, and the only way that can happen is
if they can actually get their hands dirty with it.

And I'm under no illusions about the magnitude of the task, but I'll
do as much as I can until my pound of sitzfleisch runs out. :)

Which of the three pagers that ITS supports?

I'm pretty sure I've seen documents on the KA-10 and ITS KS-10 pagers, 
although I might not be able to put my hands on them quickly.

Changing device drivers in ITS is not very much work if the device works 
and is documented (neither was usually the case, though).

ITS on the KL-10 uses custom microcode, and can't use DEC's microcode.  
So if the Toad emulates DEC's pager in hardware, the port might be next 
to impossible.  If the Toad can be remicroprogrammed, that's a lot of 
work.  Probably nothing is impossible given sufficient determination and 
willingness to waste speed and memory.

FWIW, I cobbled together a little sketch of how KS ITS paging works from
the various defs files (with clarifications from Alan Bawden):
	ftp://ftp.dbit.com/pub/pdp10/info/paging.its

>So if the Toad emulates DEC's pager in hardware, the port might be next

I asked Len Bosack about this a while ago, if I remember right the deal was,
the paging memory is maintained by microcode just like the KL/KS so it can
parse whatever kind of page tables it wants to, but the microcode is in EPROM
so it couldn't be done as a boot time thing, you'd have to burn special ROMs.
Also they have no big plans to publicly document the micromachine or spread the
source around -- but who knows, maybe someone who was a suitable big shot on
the MIT side of things could talk him into something though, you never know.
I would think the existing pager would have to be pretty different (at least
in the details) from KL paging to have space for all those extra address bits,
and the interrupt system is definitely all different (but I gather ITS has been
through incompatible changes in int structure before, from all the comments).

has already written such a program in secret, please let me know so I can
change the name of mine to avoid confusion.

Anyway it runs on UNIX (well Linux anyway, if anyone has trouble compiling it
on something else please let me know) and accepts a subset of TAR's command
syntax, to read/write/list/append to DUMP tapes.  Yes it's ugly but you
probably already know how to use it.  It knows how to read DIR.LIST files if
it finds them, since it's mainly intended for creating install tapes using the
files from the AI/MC snapshots (if you can find them, MIT still hasn't made
a decision that I know of about distribution so those who have the files have
to just sit on them for now), but it ought to work with any other DUMP tape.
Also it will automatically uncompress .Z files before writing them to tape
(only because a lot of the AI/MC snapshot files were compressed).

It supports local tape drives, remote tapes using the !@#$!% rmt protocol,
or tape image files using Ersatz-11's file format (simple, and explained
in the itstar.doc file) to preserve the blocking and tape marks, and there's
some vestigial code for my old IBM mainframe tape server which could be
turned into something in case someone else needs to talk to a tape drive
on a machine that doesn't have UNIX-style servers.

   Howabouts does LTIBLK (Bytes mapping the TUT) work?  What I've been able
   to figure out is that there are 3 bits per block on the disk.  This
   means the TUT can say one of 6 [actually 8 -Alan] things about each
   block.  I've dug through the source, but I can't find where it says what
   bits mean what.  Does anyone happen to know what file they get defined
   in, or what they are?

The relevant definitions:

  DEFSYM  TUTBYT==3               ;SIZE OF BYTES (USED TO BE 4)
  DEFSYM  TUTBP==<440000+TUTBYT_6>,,
  DEFSYM  TUTEPW==36./TUTBYT      ;NUMBER OF ENTRIES PER WORD
  DEFSYM  TUTMAX==1_TUTBYT
  DEFSYM  TUTLK==TUTMAX-1         ;HIGHEST CODE MEANS LOCKED OUT
  DEFSYM  TUTMNY==TUTLK-1         ;TUT MANY OR MORE REFERENCES

Each TUT byte is a 3-bit reference count, where TUTMNY (= 6) means "6 or
more" and TUTLK (= 7) means "locked".  "Locked" means that the block is
unavailable for files because it is either being used to store file system
meta-data (the MFD, a UFD or the TUT itself), or the block contains a bad
spot on the disk.

In a freshly salvaged ITS file system, the TUT bytes are all set to either
0 (free), 1 (part of some file) or TUTLK (locked).  While ITS is running,
the reference counts can get larger.  I forget exactly how this works, but
I think there are only -two- things that can have a finger on a given disk
block: the file system and the virtual memory system.  So in a running ITS,
the TUT bytes contain either 0, 1, 2 or TUTLK.

If what I just said was true, we could do away with TUTMNY, and just use 2
bits per TUT byte.  I don't know why this isn't the case.  Perhaps I have
forgotten some other reason for incrementing those reference counts.  Or
perhaps this is just some historical accident.  Or perhaps the Salvager
uses the additional values when it is checking the file system.

Hmmm...  I seem to recall that there was once a plan to allow files to
-share- disk blocks.  Perhaps that's why it is the way it is.  Anyone else
remember?

The salvager will happily salvage and count references for more than
one file pointing to a single disk block.  It maxes at 7, of course.
This should "never" occur, but it does anyway (trust me).  The system
will happily come up after such a salvage, and the user then will
presumably figure out which of the files is the winner of the lottery,
and which should be deleted.  Deleting the incorrect file will
decrement the count, and leave the file system in a consistent state.

Basically, this lets you delay repairing the file system until after
the system is up, so you can use some real tools to figure out what is
going on.

You're right about the TUT being incremented during swapping.

  You're right about the TUT being incremented during swapping.

I always loved this feature and here's why:

One ITS philosophy was "no surprises".  If a program opened
a file, that file stayed around no matter what.  So if a second
user deleted the file, the first user got to continue using it
until he closed it, at which point it would go away.  This extended
to the VM system: if you were running TS EMACS, and RMS deleted it
and installed a new one, you got to continue editing with the old
one as long as you wanted to; only when the last user exited would
its space be reclaimed.  That count in the TUT makes this possible.

This is opposed to the Multics philosophy of "security always wins".
If Greenberg.Multics decides to delete emacs, anyone running it gets
a fault and loses their work.

The third philosophy is "keep it simple, stupid", exemplified by
Unix:  you can't delete a file in use.  Just to make your life
miserable, you get an error message like "permission denied" or
"sharing violation" which is not self-explanatory, and there are
typically no tools available to tell you who or what is causing
the error.  The only advantage of this philosophy, so far as I can
tell, is that if you're good at selling it you can make sixty
billion dollars for yourself in just a few years.

Alright, here's what I managed to get from all this:

LTIBLKs are refrence counts.  Counting how many files use a block.
0 means free, 1 to 5 means 1 to 5 files using this block, 6 means 6 or
more files using this block, and 7 means it's locked.  (Bad block, in use
by the filesystem, or the virtual memory system).

When the system is not timesharing, this number should end up being 0, 1,
or 7.  Anything else means it could be screwed up, and needs looked at.
But it's not fatal.  The reason for this was that the system can still be
brought into timesharing with things in a less-than-happy state, so one
could use the nicer timesharing tools to investigate/fix the mess.
Or, maybe if you're dealing with shared code or something, you could link
2 executable files together this way to save disk space, or something ugly
like that.  Either way, it's not illegal, but not nice.

Did I miss anything?

I think you're confusing Unix behavior with that of Multics and Windows95.

The unix filesystems is a directed, labeled graph of references to inodes
(or vnodes) which in turn refer to the blocklists on disk.  Therefore it's
trivial to have an open file which has no name in the filesystem.  A pipe is
a good example of such a file.

Plan 9 goes a step further and uses the filesystem namespace to provide
lexically scoped access to all system resources, which does in fact keep
things very simple and clean.

Perhaps I'm misremembering, but I don't believe that's true.  A
normal "407" (non-shared) executable could certainly be deleted,
overwritten, whatever you wanted to do; when you exec one of these, the
program is read entirely into memory, and the file is never used again.
A "410" (pure-text, shared) executable could be removed, but not
overwritten, while it was running; if "foo" was currently running, then
"cc -o foo foo.c" would not work, but "rm foo ; cc -o foo foo.c" would
work fine.

I suspect that's the behavior I was remembering.

  but "rm foo ; cc -o foo foo.c" would work fine.

You're probably right.

I'd forgotten all about those magic numbers!  Sure enough, they're
still remembered in /etc/magic on new releases of Unix, which in
turn reminded me that "411" was the magic number for PDP11 executables
that used separate I(nstruction) & D(ata) spaces.

IIRC, it's about half an hour on a 2020.  Oughta be way less on an XKL.
You should be getting a line on the TTY for each file .INSRTed, I think,
which gives you some clue how things are progressing.

It should take about one minute.  I forget if it asks for tty input at 
the beginning.

Is there any reason to think the Midas you built is any good?

Is ITS paging the same on the KL as it is on the KS?  Or was there
different paging on different CPUs?

I'm not sure what exactly you're asking.  The functionality provided to 
user mode programs was identical.  (I should say is rather than was, 
since ITS running today under emulation always - as far as I know - uses 
either an emulated KS10 or an emulated KL10.)  ITS never supported 
extended addressing or anything like that (actually extended addressing 
didn't really work on the MC KL hardware, it never got the upgrade to fix 
all the hardware design bugs).

However, the page table format on the two kinds of hardware, KS and KL, 
is a little bit different.  The page table format is a lot more different 
on the KA hardware (with the Systems Concepts paging box addition), 
having no EPT, and even differed slightly on the three KAs at MIT that 
ran ITS.  Each kind of hardware can address a different amount of 
physical memory too.

The page table format is yet another format on the KI hardware, but 
nobody ever bothered to make ITS run there.  I don't know about the KC10 
(Jupiter), we never got one, I don't know if more than one was ever 
built.  ITS never was ported to Foonly hardware but if it had been the 
page table format would have deviated slightly from the DEC hardware but 
the user mode functionality would have been the same.

The ITS source code is a good source of answers to questions like this 
since the hardware format definitions are broken out into separate, small 
source files.  Look in the SYSTEM; directory on any ITS machine!

Funny, Dave.

I have asked a few times about where the source is available online, and 
so far I have not received a straight answer.

Would anyone care to say where it is?  And would anyone care to explain 
what the big deal (if any) of just putting it on an ftp site would be?

I find it wonderfully ironic, that GNU and free software have swept the 
planet, and ITS sources (for an OS that has mostly sentimental value) 
remain a closely guarded clique/cult deal.

Oh well; what the hell ;-)

The problem is that no one (that MIT trusts) ever combed through the files
and separated the system-y stuff from the personal email archives etc.
The majority of the files aren't commingled but a few system things were
personal projects and lived in people's home accounts.

A few years ago MIT decided to ask that further distribution of ITS stop
until this is dealt with.  As far as I can tell things have stalled though,
partly (IMHO) because some people think that KLH's emulator is the only game
in town and since *its* distribution got snarled up, there's no longer any
point in putting in the large amount of effort it would take to sort through
ITS, since in any case I suspect most of the (ex-)MIT crowd already has
both the ITS archive and KLH's simulator so none of this applies to them.
Real PDP-10s aren't of much interest to MIT any more, they intentionally
got out of that game a while back.

I may misunderstand the legalities here, but I think technically it doesn't
need to be this way because the system was written largely with DARPA money
so it belongs to all of us.  But a lot of people at MIT put in a whole lot of
their own effort so it seems like the right thing would be to respect their
wishes (and anyway I'm not a lawyer, I could be wrong about the DARPA thing);
in any case if one of the several free PDP-10 simulator projects floating
around is finished, hopefully that will provide some impetus for someone
with decision-making ability to look at ITS.  Otherwise it's just busywork,
since everyone with KLH10 probably has ITS, and those of us with real 20s
have generally been around since before the moratorium so we had our chance
to download everything.

As I've said before, I'd be happy to do the grunt work and come up with
a proposed list of non-personal files to be approved by someone at MIT with
decision-making ability.  It would certainly be easy to come up with a
*subset* of ITS that's definitely free of love letters, student grades,
or whatever else there is to worry about, since things like SYSTEM; and
SYSENG; and KSHACK; are definitely OK right off the bat.

What model of 20?  I've got an otherwise perfect DECSYSTEM-2020 chassis
(i.e. still the original china red and white, not painted ugly brown by ADP
like most of my other 2020s) which had the panel removed by the previous
owner (and given to Don Lewine for some reason, as if he wouldn't already
have one if he wanted it!), which makes the machine kind of an albatross.
If your panel is from a 2020, I'm not saying *I* want it, but this *machine*
wants it!  So I'd be interested in getting them together, whether it means me
getting the panel or you getting the machine or some other person getting both.
I'm having enough trouble finding homes (good homes that is, the local scrap
yard will pay $1.50/100# but I can't do that!) for my relatively complete
machines, this headless corpse will never get out of here as it is...

Thanks for your thoughts on why ITS sources are not available online, 
John.

I have long wondered what was going on.  I still wonder/suspect if/that 
it might be a case of a virtual "sacred burial site" mentality. 

Is anybody from MIT around that can she some light on this?  Does anyone 
know who at MIT would be the person to talk to about this issue?  I 
suppose I could call MIT and hunt the person down.

Anyway, it would seem to me that allowing some of the good ideas of ITS 
to live again in other systems would be a good thing.  The emulator is a 
good step, since most people can't read PDP-10 assembler, being able to 
show them ITS is a good way to explain things like TTY handling, for 
example.

Who wants to see the sources online publicly besides me?
(and who is willing to help make it happen?)

Marty

I'll put in a vote for having the ITS source, and as much else
ITS-related as possible, in the public record.

A entire generation of hackers is growing up never once having known a
real OS.  One need only read the Linux kernel source code to see the
heart-wrenching consequences of such a state of affairs.  These kids
deperately need a light to see by; if we won't provide it, who will?

Having difficulties with the emulator and Exec DDT...  I'm currently
trying to make it go.  I used xkleten to compile a SBLK binary of DDT 68,
and then fed it to the emulator.  (I taught it to read SBLK files).
The problem is at TYO3:, where something is going on I don't quite
understand.  Relevant code follows, T=5 and it has the char read from the
console.

TY03:
kl,[
	PUSH P,T
	ANDI T,177
	PUSHJ P,XDTCM
	POP P,T
];kl
	POPJ P,

...  Further down ...

XDTCM:	SETZM DTEFLG	;SEND ARG IN T TO 11, GET RESPONSE IN T
	MOVEM T,DTECMD
	CONO DTE,%DBL11
	SKIPN DTEFLG
	 JRST .-1
	MOVE T,DTEF11
	SETZM DTEFLG
	POPJ P,

What I don't understand is that the character read is being used as the
command for the DTE20.  This could be ANYTHING.  What is the DTE20
supposed to do here?  Or am I reading this different from what it's
supposed to be?

It's echoing.

The commands that do stuff other than type out a character are > 177 .

Subject: PCLSRing in the news.

ITS lovers may be interested in the following paper that's partly about
what ITS called "PCLSRing":

  ftp://mancos.cs.utah.edu/papers/atomic-osdi99-abs.html

They developed their approach to atomic system calls without knowing that
ITS did the same thing 30 years ago, but they learned about ITS while
preparing this paper, so this paper does talk about ITS.  (You'll also find
my unpublished paper that describes PCLSRing listed in their bibliography.)

This paper in being presented at OSDI '99 on Wednesday.  Jay Lepreau
(lepreau@cs.utah.edu) will be presenting, and he tells me that comments
that reach him before late Tuesday or early Wednesday can be incorporated
into his talk.  He writes:

   One outstanding issue is whether this really would make sense in a
   "macrokernel" (as in ITS?).  There the impl. complexity might outweigh
   the advantages.  And if it only makes sense in a microkernel, doesn't
   that just push all the problems out into the servers w/o giving many
   advantages for the impl. there?

   I need to get ready for nasty questions such as this.

(To make sense of this remark you need to know that their operating system
is a microkernel.  Thus one can claim that their arguments in favor of
atomic system calls don't extend to a full operating system.)

So if anyone has any particularly punchy way of making the case for
PCLSRing in a non-microkernel OS like ITS, please drop him a note.

Subject: Need help with TM03 formatter
Cc: its-lovers@mc.lcs.mit.edu

Hello!

So, I'm repairing a TM03 formatter on a TU77 tape drive. This has the  
8915-YA Bit fiddler on it (18 bit). THe problem is that the TM03 refuses to  
work, and refuses to clear it's error condition.

Checking the error registers reveals an "Invalid format" error. Checking the  
books, this can be caused by a microcode failure in the 8915 bit fiddler  
board (the formatter on 18 bit TU77's). Now, the questions:

Is it possible to find a new 8915-YA board? The one that I have will  
sometimes light it's red LED upon fireup. The light goes out in about 30  
seconds. Other times it flickers upon power up, and that's all. Is it  
possible that the problem is in the 8905-YB Maint register? According to the  
basic block diagram, these two are linked at the hip somehow.

I suppose I could pull the 8915 out of my TU45 (deep in storage) however I  
don't know if that's a YA, and if not, it won't work in a 125IPS tape drive  
(like the 77). And no, I don't want to try and fix the 45; it's a pneumatic  
nightmare...

Or I could try swapping in a 8906 and see if I can get the drive to do  
anything. 8906's are a dime a dozen; are there any backplane changes between  
the TM03 16 bits and the TM03 18 bits?

Any help appreciated. Getting this drive up is crucial.

Chris

Subject: KS-10s and RP06s up for grabs


This just landed in my mailbox; also posted to netnooz.  I'd be
interested in a KS, but no way do I want any RP06s, just in case anyone
wants to take it all and split it up.

- - - - -

Just wanted to let eveyone know that I have been contacted by someone
who works for a company where they have three (3) KS10s.  One of the
machines is *CURRENTLY OPERATIONAL*.  One was shut down several months
ago, and the person who wrote to me doesn't know about the third.

There are nine (9) RP06 disk drives distributed between the three
systems, two additional ones are broken.  Two tape drives are on
line (with problems) and one is broken (one TM03 and two TU77s).

The computers are in a room without a raised floor, so the cables
are simply laying around.

The terms are that we (whoever) takes the equipment must do so at
their own cost, and must take everything, including cables and
non-working units.

Dismantling can start April 21st, removal has to be by April
27th.  No later than this.

The KS10s take up about 6sqft of floor space each, and are about 600 lbs.,
the RP06s apparently take up about 7-9 sqft and I don't know how much they
weight.  I don't know about the tape drives.

Someone told me it may be between 6000 and 8000 lbs all together...

Systems are located in Cambridge, Massachussetts.

We need to give an answer by April 13th at the latest.

I suspect that if it isn't saved, it will go to the scrapheap,
landfill, crusher, <fill_in_your_own_worst_nightmare_here>.

So, is anyone game?  Please contact me off-list.  I'll *try* to
coordinate this.

This is a chance to handle some *REAL IRON*...

As a blanket offer, I will pay to have all of it packed and moved
down here to Maryland where I have a facility that can house the 
machines, and a T3 to connect them to the net.  

I will note that it is most likely not the right thing to try to 
run them 24x7 - they will wear out, break, and then never get 
fixed due to lack of time and spares, I have no doubt...  but I
think that it would be useful to have a KS setup around with 
ITS, tops-20 and tops-10 boot packs available to act as a
"reference model" for emulations, etc.   Sometimes, you gotta
go back to the source material, and that is something that is
going to be increasingly difficult to do in the 21st century...
I can house them in a ready-to-go state, just flip the switch, 
because I have a lot of space here (in a building that I own) 
and good net connectivity.

If this sounds good, hook me up with the right person to speak
to, and we should start planning a de-install team who really 
understands these things and won't break everything in taking 
it apart.

Thoughts?

Actually, they weren't designed to be turned on or off.
Anything other than 24x7 operation will stress 'em and
lead to premature failure.  A challenge to come up with
a happy medium for maximum useful equipment lifetime.

I agree - I anticipate that I will build the system out (with help
from friends), and hopefully get bootable tops10,20 and ITS packs 
(RP06 - such a lot o' disk space!) on seperate packs, get the tape
backup system working (as I recall from the deep dark past, that is 
always an adventure) and then shut it all down, and it would only 
come up once in a while, when someone needed it, or a couple of times
a year for an extended (days, weeks?) run to make sure that the 
capcitors stay good, etc. 

Yes, it is a delicate ballance, but running it all the time won't
work (I don't care about the power ocnsumption, it is the spares
consumption that worries me).  I guess the idea here is to build 
one machine that can survive the next 50 years and still be 
operable, in case others of the species do not survive.  Since I 
own the building that it is going in, it isn't at the mercy of 
businesses that tolerate an employees whim for a while and then 
get tired of it, or spouses who tolerate the hobby for a while 
but....   I have had both of those things happen in the past, so 
I can speak of them ;-)

Think of it as storing the DNA some place safe.

If you're talking about RP06s, you're going to have to pay a LOT of
attention to the dust filters, particularly when you change packs.
Bad filter maintenance was almost certainly behind several incidents
of multiple-pack head crashes on XX and OZ.  We also speculated that
the filters themselves break down after a while and become almost as
dangerous as the dust they're supposed to filter, but the Tech Square
machine room was a pretty dirty place, so we never proved it.

;;;  One little ITS, left all alone.
;;;  It trashed its last RP06, and then there were none.
;;;  R.I.P, 5 July 1990.

This is the kind of info that is needed - as far as I am concerned,
we can deal with this.  I think it is vital that we have one reference
system somewhere that can be used, not just for remembering back in
the day, but as a reference - DEC10 docs are sometimes vague as to
how things work, etc.

Also, it would be best to have 3 RP06's and never (seldom) take the
packs out - there is always a risk when you swap packs, dust, damage
to the spindle (hey, most people are *out of practice* with RP06 packs -
maybe we need a practice drive ;-)

Yes, I understand this will not be easy - I am willing to dedicate the
facilities to it so that we can maximize the chances of success.  If
we don't save the DNA, this species will go away.

Oh it's not dead. It's just sleeping right now in my spare bedroom, waiting  
for the damn TU77 to be fixed. LSD is here as well, and MC is huddled up down  
the road.

I've finally got machine room power (60 amps of 110 and 30 amps of 220) in  
the room, and have been working on the TU77. Something is seriously hosed in  
the bit fiddler of the TM03 controller. If I can't figure it out soon I plan  
on ordering one from DEC. Anyone got a working TM03 for an 18 bit system? If  
I had that, we'd be up and running ITS this weekend.

I won't be using RP06's though. Too big. At this point I have a pair of  
RM80's in the room, and a trio of RM03's at Doug's shed. Need to move one of  
those in soon. Tops would be helpful in diagnosing this drive.

Subject: SYSTEM IS ONLINE...

Ok. Yesterday I went over to Doug's storage shop and withdrew a pair of RM03  
disk drives to put back on old MIT-AI. Rented the truck, strapped em in, and  
brought them home.

They're here, and one of them works. I managed to boot my LAST Tops 20 Red  
pack (the other was destroyed in a head crash). However I have a small  
problem:

How does one break into TOPS-20 Version 4?

I know there is an OPERATOR account, but what's the default password? Anyone  
know? Are passwords case sensitive under T20 V4? What other accounts come on  
a Red pack, and are there default passwords for those? Is it possible to  
drop to the monitor during boot up?

Top priority now is to make an image copy of this pack. Second priority will  
be to get the RM80 up and formatted. Third is to get the TU77 diagnosed and  
repaired...

And fourth is ITS. The tapes are here, the iron is here. Now to work out the  
bugs and bring her online...

Speaking of which, does anyone have a few spare MASSBUS cables? I need all I  
can get.

Thanks

The default password to OPERATOR is DEC-20

Passwords are not case-sensitive.

If you're still having problems, I can help you break into your TOPS-20 Red
pack.  The way that I do it is to patch the password check routine to always
return true, set up a WHEEL account with a known password, then reboot.

Subject: TOPS 20 is online

Well, thanks to help from Stu, I managed to get AI's red pack re-passworded  
and running. Next step is to get the RM80 up and formatted, then test away.

After that, it looks like I REALLY need to find a TM03 formatter or 18 Bit  
fiddler for AI's TU77. If anyone has one they can lend, please let me know.

Also need to fix one of my other RM03's (it's dead), but that should not be  
too difficult. Now where did I put that box of RM03 parts....

Side question: Can one use a RM02 on a KS10? I know it's slower but I have a  
working pair of them at my parent's house. Also, where is the best place to  
get filters for these things?

Subject: RM80 up, now need to format
Cc: info-pdp11@transarc.com

Ok, things move along. I managed to get the RM80 coupled to the RM03 tonight  
(and dealt with a faulty MASSBUSS cable), but now I need to format the  
drive. TOPS-20 doesn't seem too gracious; it BUGHLTS as soon as it sees a  
pack that is not formatted in 10 format (ah well).

According to the manual, I need a program on tape called KSFORM or something  
like that. Didn't see it on the Red pack. Does anyone (Megan) have a copy?  
Did any of the ITS utilities work to format raw packs?

I'm also thinking of writing a utility to load tape images (dumped from a  
Unix box to a file) into the 20 via the serial console and lots of LD/DP  
commands. Very slow, but at this point the only way to get info in. Has  
anyone done this already?

the salvager is how you do it, if you have a way to get the salvager into 
memory (an ITS bootable disk or tape, i.e. dskdmp or magdmp).

As I rummage through the cards that came with AI and MC, I found one that

Does anyone remember anything about a "S20 controller Card", made by  
Southwestern Systems Inc? It appears to have a 40 pin connector, a Z80 CPU  
and a pile of little ROMS (20 pin DIP) on it.

Perhaps it was a serial controller, or maybe a Chaosnet IMP. Regardless,  
it's a Unibus card.

Hmm...  Do you see any jumpers/DIP switches/etc. that might indicate what
CSR it uses?  Maybe it's an emulation of some DEC controller...

It's definately not a Chaosnet card. I have one of those; I should know  
better :-)

It is Unibus though (the S20 controller). It's got CSR switch box,  
hardwired jumpers for vector, and a BRI interrupt plug. It's not SMD (I  
wish it was) since it only has one 40 pin connector.

Maybe it's an IDE controller :-) Seriously, I'm guessing BiSync  
controller or something like that.

This is a logfile from one of my machines (slowly) running the PDP-10

(For refrence, it took the poor VAX about a minute to get to a DDT.
prompt.  It happens about instantaneously on my PC (P166).  I gave up on
BOOTM and telnettted to the PC after letting it run for about 10 minutes.

Both ITS (acutally the salvager) and TOPS-10 (actually BOOTM) are
demonstrated.  Nither works because the RH10 code isn't written yet...
(Same for a lot of the processor devices) and there's prolly still quite a
few bugs in there.  Anyway, it's something.  My comments are in brackets.

ITS.1644 (The file) has a macro in it that extracts the version number
from the FNAME2 of the file being compiled.  Seeing as I named the file
ITS.MID.1644, that broke the macro and it ran in an infinite loop.
I figured it out by doing "ITS.MID.1644(LL)" to MIDAS 458, waiting for
TOPS to barf ('Cause the listing file blew over my disk quota), then,
CLOSEed the listing file and read through it.

Right now, I just tried building ITS with MIDAS 425 (Which XKL built)
and MIDAS 458 (Which I built, and I purified it), both fail.  I tried
making AI, 425 gets an illegal instruction and 458 complains that the
symbol table is full.  I'm thinking 458 has a better chance of running so
I'm correcting the error in CONFIG I made (I left an = somewhere I
shouldn't have), and trying again.  Is there a way to make MIDAS build but
not make a symbol table (I'll read the docs later...)

Update:
Raised .SYMTAB in ITS.1644, now 548 does the same illegal instruction as
425.  Error message form 548 is as follows, in case it makes sense to
anyone:

HIGHEST USED = 142463
SPACE LEFT IN UPT = 13
STORAGE PER LOSER = 1000
ITS
?Illegal instruction XCT T at A.OP1+16
?UUO simulation is disabled                                                    
Toad@

It appears to happen as the second pass starts.
Trying to CONTINUE past it makes MIDAS print EVERY SYMBOL in its as either
undefined or muliply defined, and then it dies at the end with some kind
of "successful bracket unterminated" error.

I have to go get my sister from a football game now (Spectator, not
playing), so I'll poke at this some more tomorrow.

Reproduce the problem, then at the TOPS-20 @ prompt, give the command
	EXAMINE T
(just "E T" should be good enough).

Send us the exact result.

However, I think that I already know what's going on.  I took a look at the
MIDAS.MID source code, and it looks like A.OP1 is code to handle the .OP and
.AOP pseudo instructions.  From distant memory, .OP is the instruction that
causes MIDAS to execute an arbitrary instruction, typically a UUO, something
like
	.OP GTAD%
on TOPS-20 to get the time of day into AC1 (there was also some mechanism to
get the value of ACs).

I'll bet that the ITS source code doing some ITS UUO as part of the build,
probably either the time or the system name.  After all, who would ever
compile ITS on a non-ITS system.

Find the .OP call, figure out what a reasonable value should be, and replace
it with that value.

If you still are stuck on this, I can fire up my 2020 on the ITS pack and look
further (I just looked at the TOPS-20 sources that I have on my UNIX
filesystem; I have MIDAS.MID but no ITS kernel sources online on UNIX).

If you want to compile ITS on some weird operating system, you'll need to 
comment out those lines and set the variables to zero or something.

Done and done.  Now there's just one last error I need interpreted.
You know how I mentioned before that CONTINUE generated a lot of junk as
errors?  It wasn't the continue.  ^_^  I think this is possibly my
mistake.

I retyped this from another TTY, so the spacing may be off.

Checking which machines build and which don't...
So far, only SI,FU,PM,and DX will compile. They all blow a bunch of
UNDEFINEDs in EVSYMS, but compile anyway.

It takes about 2-3 minutes to build an ITS.  The load is .43/.39/.34
without MIDAS458 running.  I'm the only non-XKL person on. ^_^

Okay, so now I can load it.  It's October 9 now, so I got 2 months and
change to get ITS running.  Easy as pie.

And after that, I'll part the Pacific (Moses was a wuss!), walk to Japan,
and get Naoko Takeuchi and Rumiko Takahashi's signatures. ^_^

Note that I purposely didn't load the salvager - if I do load it, it
starts salvager and gets confused, 'cause there's just enough of the RH10
to confuse it.  If I don't mount a pack, it complains about that instead.

Anyway, it's something...

Sorry to bother the whole its-lovers@mc.lcs.mit.edu list with this but 
it's the only way I can send mail to Mark.

Support@thecia.net please fix this.  In other words, if you still have a 
security hole please plug it, if you already plugged please get the ORBS 
people to update their list.  Thanks.

Probably what it says.

>How do I interpret "43-072"?  Pagenumber-Linenumber?

Yes.  It's assumed that you have paper listings, which no one does any 
more.  But control-S in Emacs takes a numeric argument.

If you look at 61-159 the problem is pretty obvious, you have an 
unterminated macro definition which ran for 18 pages until it finally 
found the word "TERMINATES" in a comment.

I don't see a DEFINE at 43-072, but maybe your source code is different.  
In my source code that's a very complicated call to the BUG macro, maybe 
your Midas doesn't handle that macro correctly.  Check whether you need 
EXPUNGE DEC and OCT.  (Should be EXPUNGE CPQ now I guess.)

Good thing the baby's taking a long nap or I wouldn't have been able to 
help you.

Thanks, I just read my logs and saw that had happened.  Sorry.

ORBS is the best anti-spam tool -- it stops about a dozen spams a day aimed at
my mailbox -- but it's a drag when it blocks legitimate mail.

If it looks like there's going to be a significant delay in getting off the
ORBS list, let me know at my (unprotected and frequently spammed) work
address, mrc@cac.washington.edu, and I'll put thecia.net in my mailer's list
of specially blessed sites that are always trusted.  That'll override the ORBS
thingie, although that only helps in sending mail to me, not to any other site
that uses ORBS.

[USENET: I hope you get this.  Please respond via email, the news server
is acting stupid again.  Also, this is a test to see if Pine is smart
enough to remove the Bcc recipient from a usenet post...]

Anyway, I ned a litthe help about the DF10.  I figured out a decent amount
(I think) of how it works.  The question is illustrated as follows.

First - Is the following data correct?

The way I have the DF10 at the moment, it gets it's initial control word
and start command from the RH10.  It then loads and deals with the command
at ICWA, then adds one to the address of the control word (Unless the
control word was a JUMP command) and gets the next command from there.
If the word is 0,,0 we're done.

The other question is, do I do anything at the completion of commands?  Is
there a status return of some sort? (Other than the flags you get on
CONI/DATAI of the RH10?)

If so, where am I supposed to write it and what am I supposed to write?

Third, could the DF10 be connected to more than one device at a time?
If so, how were they connected?

E10-KL10 132 is now out.  This one has the (hopefully last) fix to the IO
system, more RH10 code (No, it still doesn't work.), some code for the
TM10A (It will become a TM10B when I finally figure out the [CENSORED]
DF10), and other miscellaneous.

This time around, if we start ITS at the GO: point (Skipping the SALV
checks), it gets as far as turning on paging, with only one undefined
instruction along the way.  (It's XCTR).
Paging isn't written yet, so you get a microcode stop. (The emulator will
stop itself.)

Speaking of paging - Does anyone know how KL10 ITS paging works? I have
the microcode and can try figuring it out from that, but if anyone else
knows this already and can explain it, that will save me a lot of time. (I
have no idea how the microcode works.  I tried reading it for some other
reason, and I just confused the hell out of myself.  I bet writing it was 
a real pain in the ass... gate this to that and skip here and so on and
so forth...)

SALV itself doesn't go yet.  The RH10 heavily screwed up.  I have
absolutely no documentation for it, just the source to SALV and the
comments therein. ^_^

Also, the tape stuff uses a soon-to-be-heavily-hacked copy of
tapeio.[c,h], which John Wilson and Eric Smith wrote.  The effect of this
is that tapes from John's tape-manipulation stuff (t10backup, itstar) will
(maybe) be readable to the emulator.  I have to hack up some of the
unimplemented stuff, and get rid of the exit()s in it.  Other than that it
should work mostly out-of-the-tarfile.  Thanks guys.

Other than that, moving right along here.  This is going to be cutting it
incredibly close if I make my deadline! ^_^ (For those who don't know, my
goal is to have an ITS running in time for 2000.)

Dan:

Christ, you are doing a lot of work on this...

I've got the orig ITS manual for paging. It covers the KA/KI pager, you
might find some usefull info in there.

Send me your fax number and I will send it over on Wed.

that KS10 paging?

I believe that I was the one who wrote the KL10 microcode for
ITS paging.  It took me three months in the summer of 1975 to
get 100 lines of microcode exactly right---I think it was the
greatest effort per final line of code I have ever had to expend.

If you can email me a copy of the microcode, I am pretty sure
I can still read the stuff and attempt an explanation for you.

The MIT Museum is planning an exhibit of artifacts from the MIT AI
Laboratory.  They particularly are interested in interactive exhibits.
I'd very much like to run a copy of ITS at this exhibit.  Could we
collectively brainstorm about the easiest path to that end?  Thx.

Oooh, when's this happening? ^_^ Looks like I finally have to get my car's
transmission fixed.

Now if I can just find a way to convince my boss this is work-related, I
can get him to send me on company time... ^_^

Probably finding a real KS would be less trouble than emulation hacking.
Depends on your timeframe.

For everyone's information, I got the first cut of the ITS paging code
going last night, and got ITS to where it tried setting up the KL
accounting meters and the KL-UDGE board. (Speaking of which, what was on
the KL-UDGE, and what was it?)

Obviously it failed because none of those exist.  But I did get a
different bughalt! ^_^ (PI in progress while waiting or something like
that.)

It looks like it was quite a killer task. ^_^ Just trying to read it gives

You'll have to give me time to get it dug out.  I've just got the UCODE;

This is as good a time as any to make an announcement:

For many years, a big group of people have wanted to have an ITS
to play with - I myself am yearning for it, I know....

So, in cooperation with KLH (and many others) we are going to
bring up an ITS and make it available on the net.

Before people get in a tizzy, we are still working to have peoples
files from the MIT machines NOT included in the online version - and
we are working out the administrivia....  we are going to put things
in place to keep the machine from being used as a mail relay, porn
and warez storage facility, etc. and we are also very much interested
in everyones ideas, concerns, etc. and even volunteerism concerning
management of the machine.

So, we have all wanted an ITS to live (and only a few are able, as
MRC is, to have the Real Thing in the house) so here is the chance.
We expect the machine to be shipped from the KLH Assembly Facility
to my colo facility in Maryland some time soon, and shortly after
that we should have it up and available.

Other information will be forthcoming - ask questions, etc. and give
us input please.  We will publish some info on how it is being done,
etc. that might be of interest in the near future.

This related to the MIT Museum in the obvious way - if we pull it
off here on the net, it can clearly be cloned up to the museum
with minimum hassle.

What are you doing this with, KLH's emulator or real machinery?

Shipping what?  What have you got? (KS, KL, something else?)
Any way I can help?

Ah, my days of lugging RM03's out of basements is past ;-)
I do have a couple of 2020's in the warehouse here, and CZ
is working to breath life into one (or more) at his place,
but it was decided that if we want to have it operate 24x7
it was going to have to be on modern (and expendable) hardware.
The 2020's should, in an ideal world, be made to work as
reference resources, so that people can study ITS on a real
10 in case there are questions of how it does something (we
all know that people and documentation can be lost, so an
absolute reference would be a good thing).

So, this will be on the expendable stuff, Intel ;-)

That's nice and fast ^_^ Why not get an Alpha, so WinTel don't get any
money out of this?  (I'll leave off with this can-of-worms now)

Expendable being the operative word.  I doubt a 2020 would last much
longer in today's world of cheap, crappy hardware, bloated, buggy
software, programmers who don't know what PUSH and POP mean, and
field-servicemen whose idea of debugging is guessing which
board gets re-ordered.  -_-  Did I mention I'm in a nasty mood today?

Yeah, that's good.  You never know, there may still be bugs in KLH's
software.  Having real hardware around would be nice.

Quite frankly, Alphas aren't particularly interesting or exciting.  They're
expensive, from a single vendor with questionable commitment to the product,
and their price/performance isn't all that great.  By any reasonable standard,
the time has long passed to take the last remnants of DEC off life-support.

With Wintel, you have multiple vendors from which you can get your hardware
*and* software, and there's some major kick-ass inexpensive hardware
available.  Nothing forces you to give money to either Intel or Microsoft if
you have a prejudice against one or the other.

No Win in this Tel - just the Intel part.   I am not so much the
fanatic that I am willing to let this issue stop me from getting
an ITS operating.  It there was Windows involved, clearly something
would have to be done.  Intel itself is not a sufficient level of
evil to start up the jihad in this case.

well, I still remember getting halfway up a set of creaky basement
stairs with two guys (one of them me) lifting an RM03, the stairs
making "here we go!" sounds, and not being able to feel my fingers
any longer....  fun I prefer to remember rather than reenact.  Now
I have a warehouse and a forklift (and an RP07 if you REALLY want
heavy....)

Well, KLH has been slaving over the hot disk drives for a
while now, and I think that things are just about ready to
get crated up, shipped east, and plugged in here.  We
provided IP addresses and stuff a few days back for final
testing....  of course, things always take longer than you
might imagine, so it might still be weeks or a month or more
until we have it running - I can't say for sure.  What I can
say is that the real work is done, now it is just logistics and
configuation on the net on this side.

Damn. I hate being wrong.  You're right on both counts.

Hehe, me and a buddy dropped a whole PDP-11/44 on his toes (Broke all 10!)
while trying to get it down the hallway sideways, on a pushcart.

This makes sense if you remember that DEC, in their infinite wisdom, fixed
the rear casters of the double-wide rack so it could only be moved
forwards and backwards and not sideways.  We wanted to get the thing
(First big machine we scored!) down a narrow hallway, so we turned it on
its side, pushed it onto a pushcart (Handcart with wheels by the handle
really) and tried shoving it down the hall.  Halfway there the box slid
off the cart, and it dropped about 5 inches onto Jeff's toes.  He was very
less than pleased with me.

Aren't big machines great?  I still have the PDP-11 by the way, but not
the rack.  We de-racked it later for another move.  (That one went OK. The
only thing we dropped since was an RA81, and it landed on my hands.  That
hurt.)

Not only that, they aren't the ones truly making the money, its the vendor
that you buy the stuff from.  They bought it a few days before they sold
it to you from someone else who got it from the manufacturer overseas.  And
is there something between intel/MS that I've not understood?  We don't
necessarily have to be running any MS crocky code .. though I doubt many
of us will offer to do machine level programming on an intel platform.  Here's
my feeling .. get a good match up of cheap PeeCee hardware, get KLH's 
emulator running under a GNU system with either a linux or freebsd kernel ..
then FORGET ABOUT IT :)  boot ITS and have lots of fun.

Okay, 6 years ago I would not have responded this way, but alot has changed
including myself.  I've built many a stable machine that does not need much
tinkering using cheap peecee hardware and GNU software.  I'm not screaming
proud of it, but you can make it work and forget about it.

Windows, yes.  However, NT is not unreasonable once you get below all the
Windows crud layered on top of it.  Among other things, it has better
file/memory mapping and locking than most versions of UNIX.  Not surprising,
considering that there are erstwhile ITS and TOPS-20 hackers now working for
the Evil Empire.

Hm. Well, if ITS had remote mountable volumes (like DECNet for example)
this could be a win. It would solve the problem of disk space, as I
could have the Intel box running a 50Gb disk and an Ethernet card for my
20/20.

Of course ITS had the MLDEV long before DECNet existed...

How about the Dave Cutler fact? ("Anything DC is involved in is evil." :-)

Atleast I remember -10 people thinking that way a number of years ago.
I'll admit that I've never seen you say it though.

Maybe we should start thinking kindly of VMS while we're at it.

(Okay, I'll admit it, I'm a total RSX fan myself... :-)

I did not.

A GE-Bagbiter was a video text display terminal.  Possibly one of the 
worst ever built.  The AI lab used them for a while.

Multics was almost as far as could be possible from being a bag-biter.  I 
am referring here to the software, not the hardware it ran on!

Thanks for the great intro, Doug...

I thought I'd chip in with a few more details to help answer some of
the more obvious questions.

> This is as good a time as any to make an announcement:

Yep.  The planning for this started well over a year ago, and we had
hoped to have the system up and public by mid-July; that had to slip
because I left Oracle right before then to jump into the startup race.
I didn't want to say anything until it was all done, because
raised/dashed hopes have become so tiresome, but with TK's museum
news... well, here we go!

> We expect the machine to be shipped from the KLH Assembly Facility
> to my colo facility in Maryland some time soon, and shortly after
> that we should have it up and available.

"Soon" is an understatement.  I *have* to finish the config and ship
it out as soon as possible, because in three weeks (give or take a
number of days) we're expecting our first kid, and I'm told I'll get
even less sleep then than I'm getting now.

At that point it's up to Doug's people who will be plugging it into
their huge data pipes.  (At risk of belaboring the obvious, this would
never have happened without Doug's initiative in contributing his
time, money, and facilities -- please give him a big hand!!)

Regarding the choice of machinery for this system...

I understand the instinctive distaste for anything smacking remotely
of Wintel.  Boy, do I ever.  We struggled for a *long* time trying to
justify the quotes we were getting for a DEC Alpha clone; it would
have been far and away most appropriate for ITS to run on a DEC CPU!
Furthermore, the heavy-duty version of the emulator only ran on Alphas
(or Sparcs).

But how many people would buy an expensive workstation just to play
with ITS?  I'm as certifiably crazy about ITS as anyone else, and I
couldn't even justify it to myself.  The costs versus SPECint95
numbers were just too compelling, as was the ready availability of
free non-Microsoft OSes.  So I finally broke down and built a system
using x86 hardware for the first time, following in the footsteps of
many other (wiser and more pragmatic) hackers on this list.  That was
used to work on the x86 port over the past several months, and I put
together Doug's system using similar components.

For the hardware aficionados, the core of the public ITS machine
currently looks like this:

	Case: CalPC 4-bay ATX rackmount, 400W PS
	Mobo: ASUS P2B-F
	CPU:  P3-450
	RAM:  256MB PC133 ECC
	SCSI: DC390U2W (LVD)
	DISK: 2x9.1GB IBM drives (room for 2 more)
	NIC:  2 DEC-based 10/100
	Misc: CD-ROM, keyboard/mouse, PCI VGA.
	OS:   FreeBSD 3.2 (upgrade to 3.3 in progress)

Neither the fastest nor cheapest possible, but a workstation-caliber
machine for half the cost and with similar performance to an Alpha.

My conservative estimate is that this drives the emulator at roughly
2x KL speed.  In my primary real-world benchmark, re-assembling ITS
takes 50 seconds; file I/O is much faster with a 10K drive!  You
should be able to try it yourself soon enough.

Since all of the parts are generic, we can easily upgrade if demand
warrants.  For example, as soon as the P3-600 drops a bit lower in
price or the Coppermines get shaken down, we just pop one in and get
an instant speed boost since emulator performance is nearly linear
with MHz (or SPECint95).  Overclocking would achieve the same result
(my other system has a cheapo C300A running at 450MHz) but for a
24x7 "production" system the fewer risks the better.

The museum could run theirs on a laptop, if they wanted to...

The current leading candidate for the name of the system is
PI.ITS.OS.ORG.  Alan controls ITS.OS.ORG, and given that every ITS
needs a two-character name, PI for Public ITS is not only a
straightforward acronym but is a familiar term for PDP-10 lovers and
makes for a good web-page logo that's irrational to boot.  Other
internal test systems will be called DU and DX, which may be carrying
the MIT math angle a little too far... but DX was Doug's original
system, after all.

All that was the easy part.  There are tons of administrative issues
still to be dealt with, some of which Doug mentioned.  We do have
ideas as to how to address them, but will definitely need a lot of
help from volunteers.  I think it's great that Daniel (hmm, he needs
to get a UNAME soon :-) has made so much progress lately -- we'll need
more energy like that!

More later; I've rather over-done it for tonight.

Ken,

Thanks for making public ITS a reality.  And thanks for the details.

I have a few questions, and I hope that even if you don't have answers, 
people will create the "right" answers dynamically, which after all is 
what ITS was all about. 

First, does this in some way signal open sourcing of the PDP-10 emulator? 
Who owns the rights? How much do they want?  I can't believe we are going 
to have ITS running on a machine with an open source operating system, 
running an emulator that isn't open source. Say it ain't so. Who's the 
piper, and what's his/her price.

Which brings us to ITS itself. Now that DEC is effectively gone, and 
considering that the whole ITS system was funded with basically public 
money, how do we make it open source? RMS has made his point, and frankly 
if the emulator and ITS sources aren't online and available, it's not 
ITS.  The claim that "nothing's stopping you from understanding ITS 
except your own effort" doesn't wash if sources and documentation aren't 
online. (well, there is the obligatory hero worship and ass-kissing; the 
bribes, pagan rituals and sexual favors, but that's another thread 
entirely ;-)

I'll make the argument that ITS was more human than machine. Consider the 
amount of constant human intervention to keep it up (I still remember 
being shown by RMS how to swap chips in the KNIGHT TV-SYSTEM boards to 
move the bad buffers around), and I still hear the amount of knowledge 
stored in various people's heads. One of the reasons I supported the idea 
of a DEC-20 running TOPS-20 ("Twenex") was that I recognized that 
Symbolics and LMI were where ITS had gone, and as I sat on the ninth 
floor, trying to support MIT-AI and building MINITS boxes to be terminal 
concentrators and watching RMS busily writing LISPM compiler stuff while 
Symbolics employees did real-time screen spying on him over the 
microwave/infrared chaosnet link to their company and LMI people made 
tapes of stuff, I pretty much knew that life was gonna suck one way or 
the other. It was just too big an emotional gap to repair.  Not that 
supporting TOPS-20 was any great prize. The resentment of people whose 
heroes had deserted them made the AI Lab circa '82-'84 a hellishly 
depressing place to be...   But I digress ;-)

Back to practical matters.

>From what you describe, I could build an ITS box today.  I have a fast, 
dedicated internet connection and a Class C subnet to stick it on.  
Matter of fact, I am imagining a whole bunch of ITS machines. Once ITS is 
on stable hardware, with commodity pricing, there's no technical reason 
it can't be made to stay up for amazing amounts of time. God, do I want 
to do PEEK^K again.

So let's get right down to it. I just bought FreeBSD at MicroCenter for 
$40 bucks with doc.  So, how much for the emulator, and how much for ITS?

In my view the best thing that could happen is that PI goes up, and 
allows other people to build their own ITS boxes. The emulator and ITS 
would be open-source, and BUG-ITS@PI.ITS.OS.ORG and DEV-ITS@PI.ITS.OS.ORG 
would have traffic.

So, what's the state? Am I gonna have an ITS session in an xterm on my 
Macintosh Powerbook which is running an X Server, talking to a FreeBSD 
box which is running a KL-10 emulator emulator which is running ITS? ;-)

And let's see, can someone figure out how many core ITS machines there 
could be? Let's see  AA.ITS.OS.ORG ... ZZ.ITS.OS.ORG minus special cased 
stuff. Any reason digits are not allowed in the second part of the name? 
But this is ITS after all -- it could be rewritten to remove some of 
these restrictions...

Matter of fact, with products like VMWARE, one could have two ITS 
machines on the same physical machine. Imagine having NITS and ITS being 
tested concurrently. Hmmm, this sounds a little like the HURD...

Anyway, This is exciting.  Can't wait to get going!

Thoughts?

Marty

Right!

Yes.  Not immediately but eventually.  Here's the story, finally.
Some of you have heard this privately but never publicly.

My main concern has been to protect myself on two fronts -- one legal
and one monetary.  Both of these are now fading.

Legally, there are three different problems.  One is the Digital
intellectual property *supposedly* embodied in the emulator that would
not exist without information conveyed under non-disclosure.  Now that
much of Digital no longer exists (thank you Compaq... I think) and the
NDA is about to expire, the coast is getting clearer.  At least I feel
comfortable enough to break one of the most annoying provisions of the
Digital NDA, which is that you reveal neither the terms nor even the
*EXISTENCE* of the NDA.  (At least one consulting how-to book
specifically uses Digital as its #1 example of a company never to sign
an agreement with!)  Now, an emulator isn't much good without software
to run on it, so the second problem is the licensing requirements of
TOPS-10/20; Bob Supnik did a tremendous service here by making
hobbyist licensing possible before he bailed out.  Third problem is
the copyright/privacy issues of ITS itself -- some progress has been
made in opening this up, but there's still a lot of worms left in the
can.

Monetarily, I was hoping to regain the investment I put into the KL10
version, and for that reason was reluctant to make the original KS10
code public.  The KS10 was sort of fun and would make a good student
term project (nothing stops anyone else from doing it), but the KL10
required a lot of NDA information and an unholy amount of sweat and
blood.  (Note what GLS said about the KL paging code; multiply by N.)
The only reason I even tried was because Digital proposed to adopt it
as an official migration product if it could be done, which sounded
great to me as I was in a bit of a hole back then.  But by the time it
was working, higher-up politics forced them to back out of the deal; I
never did receive *any* money from Digital.  Instead, over time I have
acquired a few clients (very few, since I'm a hacker, not a marketer)
who have helped make it worth something in the end.  Would I do it
again?  Probably not.

A number of friends have already had copies for quite some time, but
have been extraordinarily trustworthy in respecting my request not to
reveal the fact.  If that upsets you, blame me, not them.  I apologize
to those who wanted one and couldn't get it -- all I can say is I
don't sleep well with risk, real or imagined.

My plan for the future looks like this:

    (1) Get ITS on the net.  Most people want to *use* or see ITS, not
	learn how to boot or administer their own solitary copy.
	Trust me, without the social aspect, it's really not much fun;
	ITS on a laptop is fantastically cool for several minutes and
	then... that's it.

    (2) Generate and make available free binaries that will run on affordable
	systems (FreeBSD to start with).  This satisfies most of
	the rest of the people.

    (3) When the coast is clear, make the source available
	(hobbyist-style if a market still exists, or shareware, etc).
	Everyone should then be happy with one possible exception.

    (4) Eventually GPL it, thus satisfying the exception (and posterity and
	what's still left of my youthful idealism).

Don't ask for dates; everything will depend on everything else.

> Which brings us to ITS itself. Now that DEC is effectively gone, and

The first stone was laid when certain ITS directories were GPL'd.  The
process obviously needs to continue.  Please step up with a trowel.

> So let's get right down to it. I just bought FreeBSD at MicroCenter for

I can't speak for ITS -- note that PI's initial system may have to
include directories not currently covered by the GPL, and thus will be
in a gray area.  Resolving this should be the top priority for anyone
who would like to help.

Per step #2 of my plan the emulator binary should be free.  If you
want to pay someone something, do it by contributing time (oh, okay,
or donate money for someone else to make time) for the project.

Yep, if that's what you want.  Except it will be a KS10 emulator
(faster than KL), and if you're talking about PI rather than your own
copy then you'll be using supdup.  (Who wants to port Supdup to the
Mac?)

More cogently, ITS was never written to be particularly easy to
distribute.  The IP address and host name is built in, for example,
and various programs explicitly check for running on a hard-coded list
of places.  I've identified a bunch of places that will have to
change, but this area can use a lot of work.

I don't know what VMWARE is, but you don't need it on Unix; I often
use this technique for testing.  We calculated that the 450MHz box can
probably emulate up to 4 KS10-class systems simultaneously, and have
reserved addresses appropriately just in case.

> Anyway, This is exciting.  Can't wait to get going!

Go right ahead... you're in Cambridge, yes?  So you can go start
tracking down some MIT legal beagles or whoever.  Use the museum
thing as a wedge.

If someone would like to take over the organizational aspects of this
that would be a huge help.  I'm talking about maintaining a
prioritized list of projects, who's-doing-what status, general
coordination, cheerleading, and so on.  To give you an idea of what's
needed or desirable, here's list of areas off the top of my head:

	- Get ITS legal (with as much data as possible).
		GPL more stuff
		Get author's releases for personal or ambiguous cases
	- Modern defense mechanisms (it's not the Arpanet any more).
		How to prevent, detect, recover from vandalism/abuse?
		Daily restore of frozen filesystem?
		How to control access?
			Firewall configuration?
			Outbound prohibition etc with IPFW rules
			Authorizing layer with PKI?
			PWORD/PANDA of any use?
	- ITS system/software maintenance
		System administration
		Y2K issues (!)
		DNS issues
		TCP/IP upgrades
	- ITS development
		Source control
		Mods for distribution version
		Documentation
		Speed/efficiency hacks (lots of RAM)
		Read-Only and external filesystems
		Finish C port to ITS
		Future IP
	- ITS education/publicity
		Supdup ports
		Web site with intro docs
		Web access (Java supdup, anyone?)
		History
		Course material (new gen of retro-hackers)
	- Alternative emulators, ports, or extensions
		Java version (like the pdp-1 hack).  Despite stupefying
			inefficiency, should now be faster than KA.
		Seagraves?  Grossman?  Others?
		X status client -- das blinkenlights.
	- Adopt FSF or FreeBSD/NetBSD project model or invent new one
		Web site, repository, FTP site, etc.
		Combine with other (FSF or historical OS) groups?

And no doubt more things I couldn't think of at the moment.

I would love to be able to coordinate this, but feel like I'm already
too much of a bottleneck (even prior to daddyhood).

Unfortunately time is now our enemy.  Memories fade, unread tapes rot,
and worst of all, people die.  But if we can pull all this off,
there's a reasonably good chance ITS will become an immortal part
of cyberspace.

  That's nice and fast ^_^ Why not get an Alpha, so WinTel don't get any
  money out of this?  (I'll leave off with this can-of-worms now)

"Win" is irrelevant, and "inTel" bought the Alpha processor
and fab from Digital before Compaq got the remains, so an
Alpha nowadays is as tainted as an x86, if you care about
such things.

  ... field-servicemen whose idea of debugging is guessing which
  board gets re-ordered.

This, of course, is not a new phenomenon.  "DEC Field Circus"
and "Provocative Maintenance" were common terms in Tech Sqare
25 years ago, and the following joke is probably at least that
old:

	A car is sitting on the side of the road.  How can
	you tell that it ran out of gas, and the driver is
	a DEC field-service engineer?

	He's swapping the tires.

Congratulations, and FWIW let me point out that most of the first edition
Common Lisp book got written while we had a new baby in the house.
It actually worked out quite well overall for me to do my writing
between midnight and 5 am (see the Acknowledgments in the book,
last sentence); that way I could take care of the baby the two
or three times per night that he woke up and bring him to
mommy for feeding.  The downside was not getting to see my wife
all that much because our waking times didn't overlap that well.
... Oh, a day job?  AND you want to sleep?  Well, then things
get tough.  :-)  Seriously, welcome to fatherhood and I'm sure
you'll enjoy the new little one.

Here is a summary of ITS paging for the KL10 as supported by the
microcode.  I hope you have received that faxed copy of Hardware
Memo 2, "PDP-10 Paging Device", by J. Holloway, 2/20/70, because
it has useful background and diagrams.  However, the treatment on
the KL10 is slightly different, so I am going to start from
scratch and I will point out differences along the way.

Under ITS, a virtual address space of 2^18 36-bit words is divided
up into 256 pages of 1024 words each.  A memory address is 18 bits;
because it is in the right halfword and bits are numbered from the
left, the bits of the memory addres are numbered 18 through 35.
Bits 18-25 of a memory address identify a page and bits 26-35
identify a word within the page.

The mapping hardware uses bits 18-25 to index into a table.
(This is a slight lie that I will correct below.)  Each table entry
is a halfword whose bits are numbered 0-17.

bits 0-1	00  page not accessible
		01  read only, executable by pure code
		10  read/write/first (read only, not executable by pure code)
		11  any access is permitted
bits 2-4	unused
bits 5-8	age field
bits 9-17	physical page number

A virtual address is converted to a physical address by taking
the physical page number from the table entry and using it as bits
17-25 of the physical address; bits 26-35 of the virtual address
become bits 26-35 of the physical address.  Thus a virtual address
of 18 bits becomes a physical address of 19 bits, so you can actually
usefully have 2^19 words of physical memory (of which at most half
is addressible within any given virtual address space).

The slight lie is that there are actually four tables, not one.
Two of the tables are for user mode references and two are for
exec mode references.  For each mode, there is a table for the
low half of the virtual address space and a table for the high half.

These tables reside in physical memory at locations identified
by the DBR registers.  The KA10 had three DBR registers and the low
half in exec mode was unmapped; but on the KL10 there are four DBR
registers:

	DBR1	base address of tabel for mapping low half user addresses
	DBR2	base address of tabel for mapping high half user addresses
	DBR3	base address of tabel for mapping high half exec addresses
	DBR4	base address of tabel for mapping low half exec addresses

(Yes, the order is inconsistent for user and exec; but this way the
meanings of DBR1, DBR2, and DBR3 are the same for KA10 and KL10.)

The KA10 allowed each table to be of variable length, specified by
fields DBRL in the DBR registers.  The KL10 microcode does not
support the DBRL fields; they should be zero, and each table is
always 64 words long (128 halfword table entries).

So the mapping of a virtual memory address VMA is really something like:

	if user mode
	  if VMA<17> is 0

On the KA10, a page table entry was not really read from physical
memory every time a VMA needed to be mapped.  Instead, it had
hardware associative registers into which page table entries were
loaded; in other words, it had a cache for page table entries.
This cache had a rather complicated structure that we need not go
into.  On the KL10, there is also a hardware cache.  The only
aspect of the KL10 hardware page table cache that we need to
be concerned with is the fact that it thinks pages are 512 words
long, half the size of an ITS page.  As a result, every time
the hardware cache is to be filled by microcode from a page table
entry fetched from main memory, the microcode needs to create
*two* entries in the hardware cache from one ITS page table entry.

The KA10 also had an "age bits" feature whereby, whenever a page
table entry was used to load a hardware cache entry, the 4-bit age
register was inserted into bits 5-8 of the page table entry, which
was then stored back into main memory.  This age field was
available to the operating system to help perform working set
management.  On the KL10, there is no age register; whenever a
page table entry is used to load a hardware cache entry, bits 5-8
of the page table entry are set to zero, and then the page table
entry is stored back into main memory.  (More precisely, the age
field is ANDed with a constant provided by the operating system
in accumulators LH.AGE and RH.AGE.)

Now I will give a running blow-by-blow commentary on the
microcode.  I will use the term "register" to refer to hardware
registers and the term "accumulator" to refer to one of the 128
words of fas memory used to represent the 16 PDP-10 accumulators
and for other purposes.  See the table in file "MACRO >" headed
"ITS AC BLOCKS USAGE TABLE".

We begin our story at label PGRF1.

	PGRF1:
.IFNOT/ITSPAGE
	...
.IF/ITSPAGE
	SV.VMA_AR,J/PGRF2		;AR, ARX HAVE VMA; BR HAS PFW
.ENDIF/ITSPAGE

On arrival at this label, the preliminary dispatch starting around
label PF1 has put the virtual memory address (VMA) into hardware
registers AR and ARX, and the page fault word is in register BR.
(It has also saved various hardware registers in accumulators,
because this code can be invoked as a sort of interrupt from
any place in the microcode that does a memory read or write.)
This instruction saves the VMA into accumulator SV.VMA and jumps to
label PGRF2.  By the way, the left half of the VMA has some flags
in it; in particular, bit 4 is 1 if the memory reference was
an attempt to write.

This is a good place to stop and discuss the principal hardware
registers and functional units used by the microcode.  There are
four 36-bit registers AR, ARX, BR, and BRX.  They can serve as
inputs to two 36-bit ALUs (AD and ADX).  There is also a shifter
unit that can take AR concatenated with ARX and shift a distance
controlled by register SC, the shift count.  Associated with SC is
a short adder called SCAD.

The left and right halves of AR, at least, can be loaded from
distinct sources.  It is also possible to load just bits 0-8 of
AR, or just bits 0-5 of AR (the P field of a byte pointer) from
the SC adder.  The SC adder can take inputs from several places,
including AR0-8, AR0-5 (P field), AR6-11 (S field), the SC
register, and another short register called FE (I think it's for
floating exponents, but it gets used a lot as a temporary
register).

Okay, back to the paging microcode:

;HERE TO START HACKING PAGE MAP
;AR, ARX HAVE VMA.  BR HAS PFW.
;AR, ARX, BR, FE, SC, SV.VMA, SV.PFW HAVE BEEN STORED.

PGRF2:	ARL_0S,SIGNS DISP		;SKIP ON PFW BIT 0 (USER MODE)

SHIFT
		SC_#,#/25.,		;SC GETS SHIFT AMOUNT FOR PG TBL INDEX
		AR18-21 DISP,J/PGUSRF	;DISPATCH ON VMA 2.9 FOR DBR SELECT

The macro SIGNS DISP does an eight-way dispatch on three different
sign bits; the second one is the sign of BR.  (The low-order
dispatch bit is the sign of the adder AD, and the third lowest bit
is the sign of AR, as you can discover by tracking down the
definition of SIGNS DISP in the file "macro" and of the field
value "DISP/SIGNS" in file "define", but that doesn't matter here;
the alignment directive =101 aligns the following instructions so
that the dispatch really depends only on the second lowest bit,
because KL10 microcode dispatching works by ORing dispatch bits
with the jump destination rather than adding them.)  Bit 0 of the
PFW in BR is 1 for user mode, 0 for exec mode.  ARL_0S clears the
left half of AR.

The next two instructions are identical; the only reason for
having two copies of the instruction is to remember the result of
the signs dispatch.  (These two instructions each rearrange the
register contents in such a way that the dispatch could not easily
be performed after the rearrangement.)  The AR and ARX registers
are swapped (in other words, we really wanted the left half of ARX
cleared, but only AR has that capability).  The constant 25 is put
into the shift counter SC, and bits 18-21 of AR (before the swap,
not that it matters much here) are used to perform a dispatch.

=0111
PGEXRF:	FE_AR0-8,AR_SHIFT,ARX_DBR4,J/RDDBR	;ARR GETS INDEX INTO ITS PAGE 
TABLE.
	FE_AR0-8,AR_SHIFT,ARX_DBR3,J/RDDBR0	; AR0 TELLS WHICH HALFWORD.
=0111						; FE 1.5 GETS WRITE REF BIT.
PGUSRF:	FE_AR0-8,AR_SHIFT,ARX_DBR1,J/RDDBR	; ARX GETS ONE OF FOUR DBR'S
	FE_AR0-8,AR_SHIFT,ARX_DBR2,J/RDDBR0	; DEPENDING ON EXEC/USER AND VMA 
2.9.

The alignment directives are such that the dispatch is really only
on bit 18 of AR, that is, on bit 18 of the VMA, which tells us
whether the VMA is in the low half or the high half of the virtual
address space.  We have also distinguished the cases of user mode
and exec mode, so in effect we have performed a four-way dispatch
into the four instructions above.  The appropriate accumulator
DBR1, DBR2, DBR3, or DBR4 is copied into ARX, but not before the
previous contents of ARX (that is, 0,,VMA) have participated in
a shift.  How long a shift?  Why, 25 bits, the amount in the shift
counter SC.  In effect, AR and ARX are concatenated to make 72 bits,
this quantity is shifted 25 bits to the left, and then AR gets the
high 36 bits.  If you work it out, you see that VMA<25> ends up in
AR<0>; VMA<18:24> ends up in AR<29:35>; and AR<17:28> are set to zero.
Also, before the shift happens, VMA<0:8> get copied from AR into FE;
we'll need that later at label PFWLOS.

;HERE TO PICK UP ITS PAGE TABLE ENTRY

RDDBR0:	ARX_ARX-CN100			;COMPENSATORY CROCK

	VMA_ARX+BR,SC_SC AND #,#/400	;SET UP VMA BEFORE PHYS REF
					;(BUG IN MCL BOARD: MCL USER EN)

For a VMA in the high half of the address space, the instruction
at label RDDBR0 subtracts the constant octal 100 (decimal 64) from
the DBR register value, to compensate for the addition of VMA<18>
(which is a 1 in this case) two instructions later.

At label RDDBR, AR<0:8> is copied into SC and AR and BR are swapped.
(This swap is necessary for the addition in the next instruction,
and you can't add AR to ARX directly; AR and ARX go into the "A"
input of the adder and BR and BRX go into the "B" input.)
In the next instruction, ARX and BR are added, that is, the
DBR base pointer and VMA<18:24>.  This sum is put into "VMA",
the hardware register that controls memory access; it is the
physical address of the word in memory that contains the
desired page table entry.  Finally, all bits of SC are
cleared except for the 400 bit, which originally was VMA<25>.

	LOAD AR VIA RPW,BR/AR,PHYS REF,	;BR NOW HAS PFW AGAIN.

	AR_MEM,CLR ARX,SC_#,#/18.,J/RDBRRH	; 18. FOR RIGHT HALF

We prepare to load the word containing the page table entry into
AR using a read/pause/write (RPW) cycle with a physical reference.
Also, AR is copied back to BR.  (In other words, BR now has the
page fault word PFW again; we just shuffled things around
temporarily in order to do that addition.)  Moreover, "GEN SC"
causes SC to be fed into the SC adder SCAD, and a skip (1-bit
dispatch) is performed on whether the SCAD output is nonzero.
The net effect is that we skip iff VMA<25> was 1, in which case
the page table entry comes from the right half of the word read
rather than the left half.

The next two instructions put the word read from memory into AR,
clear ARX, and load a constant (0 or 18 decimal) into the shift
counter SC.

RDBRLH:	AR_AR*LH.AGE,AD/ANDCB,		;AND OUT APPROPRIATE AGE BITS,
		STORE,J/PACCDS		; AND STORE BACK
RDBRRH:	AR_AR*RH.AGE,AD/ANDCB,
		STORE,J/PACCDS

The execution path is still split; only one of these two
instructions is executed.  The page table entry word in AR is
modified by ANDing it with the complement of LH.AGE or RH.AGE.
(Normally these are set up by the operating system to be 017000,,0
and 0,,017000 so that the age field will be cleared.)  We then
prepare to store the modified word back into memory, to complete
the RPW memory cycle.

;HERE TO DETERMINE ACCESS ALLOWED BY ITS PAGE TABLE ENTRY

PACCDS:	MEM_AR,ARL_SHIFT.C,ARR_0.C,	;GET PAGE TABLE HALFWORD IN ARL,

	SC_#,#/PPRW,AR_SHIFT,J/PGSTO	;11	READ/WRITE	; PAGES (.5K)

At label PACCDS (Page table ACCess DiSpatch), the contents of AR
are actually transferred to the memory system.  AR is shifted left
by 0 or 18 (the value in SC), and the shifter output is copied
back into the left half of AR (and the right half of AR is
cleared).  So now the left half of AR has the desired page table
entry.  The high four bits of the shifter output are used to
perform a dispatch, but only the high two bits have any effect
because of the alignment directive, so a four-way dispatch is
performed, using the ITS page table access bits from the page
table entry.  Finally, the shift counter SC is set to 1
(in effect, *after* the shift by 0 or 18 occurs).

For access 00 (no access), a page fault error code is put into SC
and AR gets the page fault word.  PFT69 handles access failures.

For the other three cases, AR is shifted left by 1; this creates
an additional bit at the right-hand end of the the left half of ARL
so that ARL now contains a physical page number measured in terms
of KL10-style 512-word pages rather than ITS-style 1024-word pages.
Also, an apporopriate constant is put into SC to indicate the
permitted page access as described by KL10-style access bits
rather than ITS-style access bits.  The read-only cases then go to
label PFWLOS and the all-access-permitted case goes to label PGSTO.

PFWLOS:	GEN FE AND #,#/20,SKP SCAD NE	;LOSE IF WRITE ATTEMPT

PGSTO:	SCADA/#,SCADB/AR0-8,SCAD/AND,	;CLEAR OUT ACCESS AND AGE BITS

PFT69:	P_SC#,ARX_SV.BR			;SET PAGE FAIL CODE
	SV.PFW_AR,AR_ARX,J/PFT		;GO TAKE PAGE FAULT

At label PFWLOS (Page Fault Write LOSes), the SC adder SCAD is used
to perform an AND operation on the FE register and the constant 20 octal.
Remember FE?  It still has some bits in it from the high part of VMA,
and the 20 bit says whether the faulting reference was a write.
The macro SKP SCAD NE causes a skip iff the SCAD output is nonzero,
so we end up at PGSTO if the referencer was not a write and
at the next instruction if it was a write (in which case the page
fault error code PF.ILW is put into SC, BR is copied to AR, and
we drop into PFT69).

At label PGSTO, we have determined that the access is permitted.
Recall that the left half of AR contains the ITS page table entry,
shifted left by one position.  The SC adder SCAD is used to clear
the high four bits of AR by feeding AR bits 0-8 and the constant
37 octal into the SC adder, performing an AND, and then stuffing
the result back into AR bits 0-8.  Then we go to PGSTO1 below.

PFT69 stored the page fail code ffrom SC into the high 6 bits (P)
of AR and begins the register restoration process needed prior
to a jump to PFT, which generates a page fail trap.  (This path
of execution will not be explained further here.)

;HERE TO WRITE TWO KI-10 PAGE MAP ENTRIES

	USER REF,J/PGSTO3		; HAVING TO DO WITH PXCT)
PGSTO3:	WR PT ENTRY,AR_ARX*4,FE_#,#/10	;WRITE 2ND PTW.  SET UP FE AND S

At label PGSTO1, SC contains KL10-style access bits (PPRO, PPRWF, or PPRW).
These are OR'd into the high bits of AR through the SC adder.  Also,
the saved VMA (the virtual address that caused the original page fault)
is brought into ARX.

The next instruction clears the 1000 bit and puts the result into
the hardware VMA register.  Recall that an ITS page corresponds
to two KL10 pages; the VMA register now points into the lower
of those two KL10 pages.

Next, the saved page fault word is fetched and we skip iff the
page fault was a user mode reference.  One of the next two
instructions then performs "EXEC REF" or "USER REF" accordingly.
(This drove me crazy for weeks.  Apparently there was some
hardware problem that failed to retain necessary state or failed
to interact correctly with the PXCT instruction.  This sequence
that does "EXEC REF" or "USER REF" compenates for that problem.)

At label PGSTO2, the macro WR PT ENTRY writes a KL10 page table
entry into the hardware page table cache from the left half of AR,
for the page indicated by the VMA register.  At the same time,
we increment the left half of AR (by using the adder and forcing
a carry out from bit 18 into bit 17).

Now we do it all over again for the higher of the two KL10 pages
corresponding to this ITS page.  We set the 1000 bit of the
saved VMA and stuff it into the hardware VMA register.  Once
again we must skip on the high bit of the saved page fault word
and perform "EXEC REF" or "USER REF".  Finally, at label PGSTO3,
we write another KL10 page table entry into the hardware cache.
We also shift ARX left two places and put the result into AR
and stuff the constant 10 octal into FE.  Why?  Don't ask *me*.
That's for the code on the next page, and I didn't write that
stuff!  But it finishes up the page fault processing, restores
registers, and resumes the faulted instruction.

Whew!  I hope this helps.

Let me add a few notes about reading the microcode.  Each
microinstruction consists of a set of items separated by commas;
if a comma ends a line (except for whitespace and comments), the
instruction continues on the next line.  Each item is either
a field/value pair or a macro call.  A macro call is simply
the name of a macro, with no arguments.  Most macros are defined
in file "macros".  Symbolic names for the fields and their
possible values are defined in file "define"; there are sketchy
comments there describing what the fields do.  If you write
microcode, you have to be aware of which fields overlap which
other fields; that's not so crucial when simply reading the
microcode.

The field definitions can tell you a lot about what is possible.
For example, these definitions (from file "define"):

ADA/=0,3,20		; (EDP3)
	AR=0
	ARX=1
	MQ=2
	PC=3
ADA EN/=0,1,18		;ADA ENABLE ALSO ENABLES ADXA (EDP3)
	EN=0
	0S=1
U21/=0,1,21,D	;BIT 21 UNUSED
ADB/=0,2,23		;CONTROLS ADB AND ADXB (EDP3)
	FM=0,,1		;MUST HAVE TIME FOR PARITY CHECK
	BR*2=1
	BR=2
	AR*4=3

tell you that the "A" input to the adder AD can come from
register AR, register ARX, the MQ register, or the PC;
or it can be forced to all zeros by the ADA EN field.
The "B" input can come from the "fast memory" FM (that's
the accumulators), BR shifted left by 1, BR, or AR shifted
left by 2.

This structure is responsible for the fact that the SOJxx
instructions are a microcycle slower than the AOJxx instructions:
the accumulator can come only into the B side of the adder, and
the adder has a function A+B+1, so by forcing the A input to zeros
you can compute B+1 in the same cycle that you fetch the
accumulator; but there is no function that can compute B-1, so you
have to pull the accumulator unchanged through the adder and store
it into AR, then compute A+1 on the next microcycle.  Until, that
is, I (ahem!) changed the code that computes the effective
address to compute and stash the value -1 into the MQ register;
it does this on every instruction, but only the SOJxx instructions
exploit this fact.  Then SOJxx can feed the -1 from the MQ into
the A input of the adder as it reads the accumulator into the B
side and the adder computes A+B!  This squeezes SOJxxx from five
microcycles back down to four.  Very squirrely; I think DEC
never accepted this change back into their main microcode source.
(Compare the code at label SOJ in files "skpjmp.32" and
"skpjmp.modelb" and compare the code at labels XCTGO and
COMPEA in files "basic.23" and "basic.modelb".)

  On the KA10, a page table entry was not really read from physical
  memory every time a VMA needed to be mapped.  Instead, it had
  hardware associative registers into which page table entries were
  loaded; in other words, it had a cache for page table entries.

The size of this cache could be discovered from user mode by
making a program that had XCT .+1024 instructions on a sequence
of pages.  The KA10 couldn't touch more than 64 pages in such
a sequence.  The KL10 could do more, but I vaguely recall that
it couldn't actually wrap around a 256K "moby".

There was a bug in the ITS KL10 microcode that caused single
stepping to occasionally execute more than one instruction.
If executing a single-stepped instruction caused a page fault
on the fetch of the instruction, the single-step trap wouldn't
go off until the next instruction.  This could continue for
arbitrarily many instructions, if you had an XCT chain as
described above.

One of the most useful features of the MIT KAs was the .JPC
register, which saved the location of the last jump instruction,
where "jump" means "anything that changed the PC by more than
one or two".  I can't begin to say how many times I've wished
for this debugging feature on other machines I've used.

Yep!  I wrote microcode for that, too, in two versions: save the
last location or save the last 16 (in a ring bufer).  It looks as
though this microcode is disabled by default, and maybe there was
some bad interaction with page faults?  See the comments from
1978 in file "define".

VMWARE is a toy that lets you run Win95/NT/DOS/etc. in an X-window
under Linux (Other UNIXes too?).  It looks like a cool hack but I don't
have a real need for it so I never got a copy.  (It's a commercial toy.)

Yeah, has anyone got good enough pictures of a (KA/KI/PDP6) such that the

Or better still, build a set of boxes you can sit on your desk with LEDs

This can't be correct for the KL10.  MIT-MC had at least 2 MW of physical 
memory.  I also think there was a cache enable bit in the ITS KL10 PTW.  
Maybe you are describing the page table word format for KS10 paging?  
(Although the rest of your writeup appears to match the KL10 microcode 
that you wrote, as I remember it.)

It was fun seeing all those micro hacks again, and described so lucidly.

Theactual microcode you quoted in your message appears to allow all the 
low 14 hardware PTW bits to be copied from the ITS PTW.  I'm only 
questioning the ITS PTW bits you described.  I looked around but I don't 
seem to have documentation on the ITS KL page table word format, although 
I did find some fun stuff like "WHEN TURNING THE SYSTEM ON, THE LAST

ACCESS THAT DISK FOR SOME REASON." (uppercase original)

Unfortunately I don't remember this.  Probably the JPC code triggered 
some hardware bug.  There were a lot hardware bugs in the KL10A that was 
MIT-MC.

I don't have KL10 microcode sources (except for the SDS-940 emulator I 
wrote on contract) so I can't check the 1978 comment where the JPC 
feature was turned off.

You know, you're right.  The one thing that didn't quite click
in my mind as I went over the microcode was that constant octal 37
at label PGSTO.  It is now clear that the KL10 ITS page table entry
actually has 13 bits of ITS physical page number (= 14 bits of KL10
physical page number), thus allowing for 32 mobies of physical memory
(= 32 megabytes, if a byte is 9 bits).  I'll revise the description.
And I bet that examination of the source of ITS will reveal that the
bits in LH.AGE and RH.AGE are to the left of those 13 bits (and to the
right of the access bits, which leaves at most 3 bits for the age field).

I have revised the description in accordance with Moon's
comments about a physical address space of 2^23 words on the KL10.
I have also made numerous small typoggraphical corrections.

--Guy


Guy Steele 11/2/99

Here is a summary of ITS paging for the KL10 as supported by the
microcode.  I hope you have received that faxed copy of Hardware
Memo 2, "PDP-10 Paging Device", by J. Holloway, 2/20/70, because
it has useful background and diagrams.  However, the treatment on
the KL10 is slightly different, so I am going to start from
scratch and I will point out differences along the way.

Under ITS, a virtual address space of 2^18 36-bit words is divided
up into 256 pages of 1024 words each.  A memory address is 18 bits;
because it is in the right halfword and bits are numbered from the
left, the bits of the memory addres are numbered 18 through 35.
Bits 18-25 of a memory address identify a page and bits 26-35
identify a word within the page.

The mapping hardware uses bits 18-25 to index into a table.
(This is a slight lie that I will correct below.)  Each table entry
is a halfword whose bits are numbered 0-17.

On the KA10, a table entry looks like this:

bits 0-1	00  page not accessible
		01  read only, executable by pure code
		10  read/write/first (read only, not executable by pure code)
		11  any access is permitted
bits 2-4	unused
bits 5-8	age field
bits 9-17	physical page number

On the KA10, a virtual address is converted to a physical address by
taking the physical page number from the table entry and using it as
bits 17-25 of the physical address; bits 26-35 of the virtual address
become bits 26-35 of the physical address.  Thus a virtual address of
18 bits becomes a physical address of 19 bits, so you can actually
usefully have 2^19 words of physical memory (of which at most half is
addressible within any given virtual address space).

On the KL10, a table entry looks like this:

bits 0-1	00  page not accessible
		01  read only, executable by pure code
		10  read/write/first (read only, not executable by pure code)
		11  any access is permitted
bits 2-4	age field
bits 5-17	physical page number

On the KL10, a virtual address is converted to a physical address by
taking the physical page number from the table entry and using it as
bits 13-25 of the physical address; bits 26-35 of the virtual address
become bits 26-35 of the physical address.  Thus a virtual address of
18 bits becomes a physical address of 23 bits, so you can actually
usefully have 2^23 words of physical memory (of which at most 2^18
words is addressible within any given virtual address space).

The slight lie is that there are actually four tables, not one.
Two of the tables are for user mode references and two are for
exec mode references.  For each mode, there is a table for the
low half of the virtual address space and a table for the high half.

These tables reside in physical memory at locations identified
by the DBR registers.  The KA10 had three DBR registers and the low
half in exec mode was unmapped; but on the KL10 there are four DBR
registers:

	DBR1	base address of tabel for mapping low half user addresses
	DBR2	base address of tabel for mapping high half user addresses
	DBR3	base address of tabel for mapping high half exec addresses
	DBR4	base address of tabel for mapping low half exec addresses

(Yes, the order is inconsistent for user and exec; but this way the
meanings of DBR1, DBR2, and DBR3 are the same for KA10 and KL10.)

The KA10 allowed each table to be of variable length, specified by
fields DBRL in the DBR registers.  The KL10 microcode does not
support the DBRL fields; they should be zero, and each table is
always 64 words long (128 halfword table entries).

So the mapping of a virtual memory address VMA is really something like:

	if user mode
	  if VMA<17> is 0
	    temp = DBR1
	  else
	    temp = DBR2
	else
	  if VMA<17> is 0
	    temp = DBR4
	  else
	    temp = DBR3
	word = fetch(temp + VMA<18:24>)
	if VMA<25> is 0
	  entry = lefthalf(word)
	else
	  entry = righthalf(word)
	PMA = entry<9:17> // VMA<26:35>		;bit concatenation

On the KA10, a page table entry was not really read from physical
memory every time a VMA needed to be mapped.  Instead, it had
hardware associative registers into which page table entries were
loaded; in other words, it had a cache for page table entries.
This cache had a rather complicated structure that we need not go
into.  On the KL10, there is also a hardware cache.  The only
aspect of the KL10 hardware page table cache that we need to
be concerned with is the fact that it thinks pages are 512 words
long, half the size of an ITS page.  As a result, every time
the hardware cache is to be filled by microcode from a page table
entry fetched from main memory, the microcode needs to create
*two* entries in the hardware cache from one ITS page table entry.

The KA10 also had an "age bits" feature whereby, whenever a page table
entry was used to load a hardware cache entry, the 4-bit age register
was inserted into bits 5-8 of the page table entry, which was then
stored back into main memory.  This age field was available to the
operating system to help perform working set management.  On the KL10,
there is no age register; whenever a page table entry is used to load
a hardware cache entry, certain bits of the page table entry are set
to zero, and then the page table entry is stored back into main
memory.  (More precisely, the page table entry is ANDed with the
complement of a constant provided by the operating system in
accumulators LH.AGE and RH.AGE.)

Now I will give a running blow-by-blow commentary on the
microcode.  I will use the term "register" to refer to hardware
registers and the term "accumulator" to refer to one of the 128
words of fast memory used to represent the 16 PDP-10 accumulators
and for other purposes.  See the table in file "MACRO >" headed
"ITS AC BLOCKS USAGE TABLE".

We begin our story at label PGRF1.

	PGRF1:
.IFNOT/ITSPAGE
	...
.IF/ITSPAGE
	SV.VMA_AR,J/PGRF2		;AR, ARX HAVE VMA; BR HAS PFW
.ENDIF/ITSPAGE

On arrival at this label, the preliminary dispatch starting around
label PF1 has put the virtual memory address (VMA) into hardware
registers AR and ARX, and the page fault word is in register BR.
(It has also saved various hardware registers in accumulators,
because this code can be invoked as a sort of interrupt from
any place in the microcode that does a memory read or write.)
This instruction saves the VMA into accumulator SV.VMA and jumps to
label PGRF2.  By the way, the left half of the VMA has some flags
in it; in particular, bit 4 is 1 if the memory reference was
an attempt to write.

This is a good place to stop and discuss the principal hardware
registers and functional units used by the microcode.  There are
four 36-bit registers AR, ARX, BR, and BRX.  They can serve as
inputs to two 36-bit ALUs (AD and ADX).  There is also a shifter
unit that can take AR concatenated with ARX and shift a distance
controlled by register SC, the shift count.  Associated with SC is
a short adder called SCAD.

The left and right halves of AR, at least, can be loaded from
distinct sources.  It is also possible to load just bits 0-8 of
AR, or just bits 0-5 of AR (the P field of a byte pointer) from
the SC adder.  The SC adder can take inputs from several places,
including AR0-8, AR0-5 (P field), AR6-11 (S field), the SC
register, and another short register called FE (I think it's for
floating exponents, but it gets used a lot as a temporary
register).

Okay, back to the paging microcode:

;HERE TO START HACKING PAGE MAP
;AR, ARX HAVE VMA.  BR HAS PFW.
;AR, ARX, BR, FE, SC, SV.VMA, SV.PFW HAVE BEEN STORED.

PGRF2:	ARL_0S,SIGNS DISP		;SKIP ON PFW BIT 0 (USER MODE)

SHIFT
		SC_#,#/25.,		;SC GETS SHIFT AMOUNT FOR PG TBL INDEX
		AR18-21 DISP,J/PGUSRF	;DISPATCH ON VMA 2.9 FOR DBR SELECT

The macro SIGNS DISP does an eight-way dispatch on three different
sign bits; the second one is the sign of BR.  (The low-order
dispatch bit is the sign of the adder AD, and the third lowest bit
is the sign of AR, as you can discover by tracking down the
definition of SIGNS DISP in the file "macro" and of the field
value "DISP/SIGNS" in file "define", but that doesn't matter here;
the alignment directive =101 aligns the following instructions so
that the dispatch really depends only on the second lowest bit,
because KL10 microcode dispatching works by ORing dispatch bits
with the jump destination rather than adding them.)  Bit 0 of the
PFW in BR is 1 for user mode, 0 for exec mode.  ARL_0S clears the
left half of AR.

The next two instructions are identical; the only reason for
having two copies of the instruction is to remember the result of
the signs dispatch.  (These two instructions each rearrange the
register contents in such a way that the dispatch could not easily
be performed after the rearrangement.)  The AR and ARX registers
are swapped (in other words, we really wanted the left half of ARX
cleared, but only AR has that capability).  The constant 25 is put
into the shift counter SC, and bits 18-21 of AR (before the swap,
not that it matters much here) are used to perform a dispatch.

=0111
PGEXRF:	FE_AR0-8,AR_SHIFT,ARX_DBR4,J/RDDBR	;ARR GETS INDEX INTO ITS PAGE 
TABLE.
	FE_AR0-8,AR_SHIFT,ARX_DBR3,J/RDDBR0	; AR0 TELLS WHICH HALFWORD.
=0111						; FE 1.5 GETS WRITE REF BIT.
PGUSRF:	FE_AR0-8,AR_SHIFT,ARX_DBR1,J/RDDBR	; ARX GETS ONE OF FOUR DBR'S
	FE_AR0-8,AR_SHIFT,ARX_DBR2,J/RDDBR0	; DEPENDING ON EXEC/USER AND VMA 
2.9.

The alignment directives are such that the dispatch is really only
on bit 18 of AR, that is, on bit 18 of the VMA, which tells us
whether the VMA is in the low half or the high half of the virtual
address space.  We have also distinguished the cases of user mode
and exec mode, so in effect we have performed a four-way dispatch
into the four instructions above.  The appropriate accumulator
DBR1, DBR2, DBR3, or DBR4 is copied into ARX, but not before the
previous contents of ARX (that is, 0,,VMA) have participated in
a shift.  How long a shift?  Why, 25 bits, the amount in the shift
counter SC.  In effect, AR and ARX are concatenated to make 72 bits,
this quantity is shifted 25 bits to the left, and then AR gets the
high 36 bits.  If you work it out, you see that VMA<25> ends up in
AR<0>; VMA<18:24> ends up in AR<29:35>; and AR<17:28> are set to zero.
Also, before the shift happens, VMA<0:8> gets copied from AR into FE;
we'll need that later at label PFWLOS.

;HERE TO PICK UP ITS PAGE TABLE ENTRY

RDDBR0:	ARX_ARX-CN100			;COMPENSATORY CROCK

	VMA_ARX+BR,SC_SC AND #,#/400	;SET UP VMA BEFORE PHYS REF
					;(BUG IN MCL BOARD: MCL USER EN)

For a VMA in the high half of the address space, the instruction
at label RDDBR0 subtracts the constant octal 100 (decimal 64) from
the DBR register value, to compensate for the addition of VMA<18>
(which is a 1 in this case) two instructions later.

At label RDDBR, AR<0:8> is copied into SC and AR and BR are swapped.
(This swap is necessary for the addition in the next instruction,
because you can't add AR to ARX directly; AR and ARX go into the "A"
input of the adder and BR and BRX go into the "B" input.)
In the next instruction, ARX and BR are added, that is, the
DBR base pointer and VMA<18:24>.  This sum is put into "VMA",
the hardware register that controls memory access; it is the
physical address of the word in memory that contains the
desired page table entry.  Finally, all bits of SC are
cleared except for the 400 bit, which originally was VMA<25>.

	LOAD AR VIA RPW,BR/AR,PHYS REF,	;BR NOW HAS PFW AGAIN.

	AR_MEM,CLR ARX,SC_#,#/18.,J/RDBRRH	; 18. FOR RIGHT HALF

We prepare to load the word containing the page table entry into
AR using a read/pause/write (RPW) cycle with a physical reference.
Also, AR is copied back to BR.  (In other words, BR now has the
page fault word PFW again; we just shuffled things around
temporarily in order to do that addition.)  Moreover, "GEN SC"
causes SC to be fed into the SC adder SCAD, and a skip (1-bit
dispatch) is performed on whether the SCAD output is nonzero.
The net effect is that we skip iff VMA<25> was 1, in which case
the page table entry comes from the right half of the word read
rather than the left half.

The next two instructions put the word read from memory into AR,
clear ARX, and load a constant (0 or 18 decimal) into the shift
counter SC.

RDBRLH:	AR_AR*LH.AGE,AD/ANDCB,		;AND OUT APPROPRIATE AGE BITS,
		STORE,J/PACCDS		; AND STORE BACK
RDBRRH:	AR_AR*RH.AGE,AD/ANDCB,
		STORE,J/PACCDS

The execution path is still split; only one of these two
instructions is executed.  The page table entry word in AR is
modified by ANDing it with the complement of LH.AGE or RH.AGE.
(Normally these are set up by the operating system to be 0?0000,,0
and 0,,0?0000 so that the age field will be cleared.)  We then
prepare to store the modified word back into memory, to complete
the RPW memory cycle.

;HERE TO DETERMINE ACCESS ALLOWED BY ITS PAGE TABLE ENTRY

	SC_#,#/PPRW,AR_SHIFT,J/PGSTO	;11	READ/WRITE	; PAGES (.5K)

At label PACCDS (Page table ACCess DiSpatch), the contents of AR
are actually transferred to the memory system.  AR is shifted left
by 0 or 18 (the value in SC), and the shifter output is copied
back into the left half of AR (and the right half of AR is
cleared).  So now the left half of AR has the desired page table
entry.  The high four bits of the shifter output are used to
perform a dispatch, but only the high two bits have any effect
because of the alignment directive, so a four-way dispatch is
performed, using the ITS page table access bits from the page
table entry.  Finally, the shift counter SC is set to 1
(in effect, *after* the shift by 0 or 18 occurs).

For access 00 (no access), a page fault error code is put into SC
and AR gets the page fault word.  PFT69 handles access failures.

For the other three cases, AR is shifted left by 1; this creates
an additional bit at the right-hand end of the the left half of ARL
so that ARL now contains a physical page number measured in terms
of KL10-style 512-word pages rather than ITS-style 1024-word pages.
Also, an appropriate constant is put into SC to indicate the
permitted page access as described by KL10-style access bits
rather than ITS-style access bits.  The read-only cases then go to
label PFWLOS and the all-access-permitted case goes to label PGSTO.

PFWLOS:	GEN FE AND #,#/20,SKP SCAD NE	;LOSE IF WRITE ATTEMPT

PGSTO:	SCADA/#,SCADB/AR0-8,SCAD/AND,	;CLEAR OUT ACCESS AND AGE BITS

PFT69:	P_SC#,ARX_SV.BR			;SET PAGE FAIL CODE
	SV.PFW_AR,AR_ARX,J/PFT		;GO TAKE PAGE FAULT

At label PFWLOS (Page Fault Write LOSes), the SC adder SCAD is used
to perform an AND operation on the FE register and the constant 20 octal.
Remember FE?  It still has some bits in it from the high part of VMA,
and the 20 bit says whether the faulting reference was a write.
The macro SKP SCAD NE causes a skip iff the SCAD output is nonzero,
so we end up at PGSTO if the referencer was not a write and
at the next instruction if it was a write (in which case the page
fault error code PF.ILW is put into SC, BR is copied to AR, and
we drop into PFT69).

At label PGSTO, we have determined that the access is permitted.
Recall that the left half of AR contains the ITS page table entry,
shifted left by one position.  The SC adder SCAD is used to clear the
high four bits of AR by feeding AR bits 0-8 and the constant 37 octal
into the SC adder, performing an AND, and then stuffing the result
back into AR bits 0-8.  This clears out the access and age fields,
leaving just the KL10 physical page number.  Then we go to PGSTO1
below.

PFT69 stored the page fail code from SC into the high 6 bits (P)
of AR and begins the register restoration process needed prior
to a jump to PFT, which generates a page fail trap.  (This path
of execution will not be explained further here.)

;HERE TO WRITE TWO KI-10 PAGE MAP ENTRIES

PGSTO3:	WR PT ENTRY,AR_ARX*4,FE_#,#/10	;WRITE 2ND PTW.  SET UP FE AND S

At label PGSTO1, SC contains KL10-style access bits (PPRO, PPRWF, or PPRW).
These are OR'd into the high bits of AR through the SC adder.  Also,
the saved VMA (the virtual address that caused the original page fault)
is brought into ARX.

The next instruction clears the 1000 bit and puts the result into
the hardware VMA register.  Recall that an ITS page corresponds
to two KL10 pages; the VMA register now points into the lower
of those two KL10 pages.

Next, the saved page fault word is fetched and we skip iff the
page fault was a user mode reference.  One of the next two
instructions then performs "EXEC REF" or "USER REF" accordingly.
(This drove me crazy for weeks.  Apparently there was some
hardware problem that failed to retain necessary state or failed
to interact correctly with the PXCT instruction.  This sequence
that does "EXEC REF" or "USER REF" compenates for that problem.)

At label PGSTO2, the macro WR PT ENTRY writes a KL10 page table
entry into the hardware page table cache from the left half of AR,
for the page indicated by the VMA register.  At the same time,
we increment the left half of AR (by using the adder and forcing
a carry out from bit 18 into bit 17).

Now we do it all over again for the higher of the two KL10 pages
corresponding to this ITS page.  We set the 1000 bit of the
saved VMA and stuff it into the hardware VMA register.  Once
again we must skip on the high bit of the saved page fault word
and perform "EXEC REF" or "USER REF".  Finally, at label PGSTO3,
we write another KL10 page table entry into the hardware cache.
We also shift ARX left two places and put the result into AR
and stuff the constant 10 octal into FE.  Why?  Don't ask *me*.
That's for the code on the next page, and I didn't write that
stuff!  But it finishes up the page fault processing, restores
registers, and resumes the faulted instruction.

Whew!  I hope this helps.

Let me add a few notes about reading the microcode.  Each
microinstruction consists of a set of items separated by commas;
if a comma ends a line (except for whitespace and comments), the
instruction continues on the next line.  Each item is either
a field/value pair or a macro call.  A macro call is simply
the name of a macro, with no arguments.  Most macros are defined
in file "macros".  Symbolic names for the fields and their
possible values are defined in file "define"; there are sketchy
comments there describing what the fields do.  If you write
microcode, you have to be aware of which fields overlap which
other fields; that's not so crucial when simply reading the
microcode.

The field definitions can tell you a lot about what is possible.
For example, these definitions (from file "define"):

ADA/=0,3,20		; (EDP3)
	AR=0
	ARX=1
	MQ=2
	PC=3
ADA EN/=0,1,18		;ADA ENABLE ALSO ENABLES ADXA (EDP3)
	EN=0
	0S=1
U21/=0,1,21,D	;BIT 21 UNUSED
ADB/=0,2,23		;CONTROLS ADB AND ADXB (EDP3)
	FM=0,,1		;MUST HAVE TIME FOR PARITY CHECK
	BR*2=1
	BR=2
	AR*4=3

tell you that the "A" input to the adder AD can come from
register AR, register ARX, the MQ register, or the PC;
or it can be forced to all zeros by the ADA EN field.
The "B" input can come from the "fast memory" FM (that's
the accumulators), BR shifted left by 1, BR, or AR shifted
left by 2.

This structure is responsible for the fact that the SOJxx
instructions are a microcycle slower than the AOJxx instructions:
the accumulator can come only into the B side of the adder, and
the adder has a function A+B+1, so by forcing the A input to zeros
you can compute B+1 in the same cycle that you fetch the
accumulator; but there is no function that can compute B-1, so you
have to pull the accumulator unchanged through the adder and store
it into AR, then compute A+1 on the next microcycle.  Until, that
is, I (ahem!) changed the code that computes the effective
address to compute and stash the value -1 into the MQ register;
it does this on every instruction, but only the SOJxx instructions
exploit this fact.  Then SOJxx can feed the -1 from the MQ into
the A input of the adder as it reads the accumulator into the B
side and the adder computes A+B!  This squeezes SOJxxx from five
microcycles back down to four.  Very squirrely; I think DEC
never accepted this change back into their main microcode source.
(Compare the code at label SOJ in files "skpjmp.32" and
"skpjmp.modelb" and compare the code at labels XCTGO and
COMPEA in files "basic.23" and "basic.modelb".)

I have a KA console still - more to the point, Peter Lothberg has
complete KL and even KI 10's and of course a KA or two, in Sweden.
At a minimum, photos could be obtained, and perhaps even more -
if he decides to send them to their great reward, either the machines
themselves could be saved (the irony of paying for them to come
BACK to the US in some cases is just too much) or the consoles from
them couple be obtained.

In the end, this is why action is needed now.  The place of the 6/10

Actually no. Intel bought the fab, but not the Alpha. That one is now in
the hands of Compaq. Intel did, however, as a part of the settlement with
DEC agree to produce Alphas.

Thinkung even more, there is also a consortium for the Alpha, in which
Samsung (and whoever else makes the Alpha) is part of. Not sure what say
they have in this...

Subject: Seeking tarball of MIT LispM resources

Hello All;

In order that I might write a LispM emulator, I am seeking the old, MIT
CONS and/or CADR software and documentation which (I am told) were
backed up along with the ITS machines (God rest their souls).  I have
been able to track down a copy, but it's at the other end of a very
narrow bit-pipe.  I am hoping that one of you will have a
higher-bandwidth delivery mechanism available.

While my mail transfer agent will probably not gag upon an enormous
attachment, anonymous ftp to ftp.mak.com (which should have sufficient
disk space, and is available via a T1) is probably best.

Thank you,

p.s.; I only used the ITS machines very briefly, lo, those many years
ago, and only for email.  Does this make me an "its-lover?"

I know it is poor form to follow-up one's own message, but I forgot to
add that two particular items would be especially valuable:

(1) a bootable band, saved world, load, or whatever they're called these
days., and
(2) enough documentation (e.g., source code) to be able to parse the
band...

Sorry for the omission.

Thanks again,

Is there someone out there with access to the contents of the MIT ITS

Assuming there aren't copyright problems with it, of course.

Ken, 

Thanks for your message.  

You may not like some of what I'm going to say here, but I think it needs 
to be said. and in public. and now.  So please hear me out. I think we're 
more in agreement than not, but the "not" part needs to be talked about. 

I've been thinking about what you said since Monday. I have very mixed 
emotions. 

I have mixed emotions because I spent some very challenging years 
supporting ITS and non-ITS machines for the AI lab.  Years perhaps better 
forgotten, but here I am 20 years later, still thinking and writing about 
those times, and yesterday I made inquiries with an MIT official about 
beginning the legal processes required to publicly license ITS.
 
On the one hand, I'm glad something is finally getting done. I think ITS 
has some great ideas embedded in it. Ideas that could and should be 
explored more.

One thing you said bothered me a lot:

>	(hobbyist-style if a market still exists, or shareware, etc).
>	Everyone should then be happy with one possible exception.

That's hard to forgive.  You don't like RMS. Fine. Kindly grow up and get 
the f*#k over it.  Face it: His code and his inspired gnu public license 
have allowed more people to have the freedom to create and learn about 
computers than your efforts probably ever will.  Sucks, doesn't it?

Hmmm, not bad. What have you been up to in the last 10 years? What have 
you done that made a global difference? How many people are using the KLH 
Public License? (and can talk about it without fear of being sent to 
jail).

Maybe that's what bugs you. Sure he's unreasonable, pig-headed, and 
inflammatory. and brilliant. So's Moon. So's TK. So's GJS, So's RG. and 
so might people say the same of you.  and me.

The cold, hard truth is, that you signed a bad business deal which has 
made it legally impractical for you to be very involved with getting ITS 
up in some public form because you might get sued and accused of using 
NDA knowledge.  Look, I understand bad decisions. I've made them, and 
I've lived with the consequences of them, and I've moved on.

But let's get right down into it.  This isn't about whether the frigging 
XCT instruction sometimes steps over too many instructions.  It's more 
about egos. It's about disillusionment and denial. It's about time we 
were just honest and took off the gloves and stepped outside and got it 
over with.

I think the deal is that a some people thought because they were 
brilliant that the world would beat a path to their door.  But it didn't 
happen that way. Unix won. LISP is mostly dead. Dylan is mostly dead. 
Symbolics is mostly dead.  And ITS, the OS (the _community_) that spawned 
so much, is deeply fragmented, because the building that we gathered in 
and the table we sat at does not exist, and the plans are in 10 places 
and the builders are scattered, like so many homeless cathedral builders.

You want to build a museum for ITS?  A shrine? Not me. I want to get it 
up on as many systems as possible by making it publicly available and 
showcase the good ideas, and see what happens.  See where the ideas show 
up ;-)

Do you remember WHY there were TURISTS on ITS?  (besides providing fun 
for bored grad students and lab people :-) It was because "you never 
know" who's going to make an important contribution.  So in this day of 
ubiquitous Internet, it makes sense to allow more people to experience 
ITS, and to learn from it. And to "not know" what will happen, or who 
will do it.  

For all the determinism we seek in our compilers and our lives, we 
embrace the unknown. Just as you are doing now, as you accept the genetic 
results of what someone described as "life's longing for itself".

This is only the first message I'm writing about this subject.  I'll get 
to more technical/practical matters later, but I think we need to do a 
"gut check" first.  I've got better things to do if we're not going to 
focus on getting this thing up in a way that will make it public (license 
terms to be discussed).  

20 years ago a former ITS TURIST sold everything he owned to come to 
Cambridge to the AI Lab to work with the people that created ITS.  He 
mistakenly thought that other people's opinions of his worth were more 
important than his own. He has since corrected that error.

So what's it gonna be?  Are we gonna make little ITS's or "just be 
friends"?

--Marty

P.S. I know quite well after sharing an office with Penny Berman and 
watching her work for days to find blocks-world sources on old DUMP tapes 
for somebody that if someone would just put up an ITS filesystem on a 
Unix box (I'll donate the box and the bandwidth if that's a problem), a 
group of us could sanitize it in no time.  How much data are we talking 
about?  Would it fit on a CD?  Who's up for going dir by dir.  We could 
form a sub-list to split up the work and compare notes.  How about it, 
Alan or whoever HAS the sources.  If I had them, I'd work on it.  Let's 
get this thing UP. 

This hand-waving legal stuff is getting pretty suspicious. On the one 
hand "nobody cares" and on the other hand "we could all go to jail", 
Yeah, yeah, that's the ticket...

Ken,

Assuming we're still talking after my last message, I have some more 
questions (and some suggestions).

I'm interested in bringing up an ITS, and have hardware, net connection, 
FreeBSD, and some time.

- Does the the KS10 emulator fall under NDA?  What is the 
copyright/license status of that emulator?  Is the source available on 
the net anywhere?

- When does this NDA expire?  I'd like to think it was December 31, 1999, 
since you are willing to talk about it now.

- How much money would you want to make the KS10 emulator GPL'ed?  Maybe 
some of us who are able could pitch in and pay you to make it worth your 
while.

That's alright, I can just use an xterm on the mac to a unix system, and 
supdup from there.  Of course, since MacOS 10 (due next year) is going to 
be Mach (unix) based... perhaps the port will be easier than we think :-)

I want to get a legal opinion on whether most of the code needs to be 
licensed. It was developed using public money on a machine with no file 
protection and was up for years.  Anyone making the argument that they 
are getting screwed is going to have to be extremely creative.  I can't 
wait to describe :OS and :PRMAIL to the legal department :-)

I'm already working on some of the things you mention. Of course, until 
we have an emulator, it's all speculative...  of course since Dan 
Seagraves seems to be making such fine progress without an NDA, the 
argument could be strengthened that much is in the public domain at this 
point.

not sure what you mean by "legal"

uh, what is the status of this?  who is in charge?  does this person 
"own" the data somehow?

um, again - this is weird.  they wrote code 15 years ago, left it on a 
machine with no file protection, and uh, the company that made the 
computer was acquired, and now they want money???? :-)

There are many modern paradigms that can be used here. The best 
protection is possibly old-fashioned community, however.  If there are 
people logged onto the machine spying (in the best tradition of ITS) they 
can help.  ITS was a human system, and for better (and sometimes for 
worse) bots and scripts were frowned upon.  ipchains and fw rules could 
be used, i spoze. and hell, i think there should be a webcam showing 
people using ITS -- you know a session running :OS spying on various 
users.  Hell, I met a good friend spying on her while she was reading my 
mail! ;-)

Is the filesystem implemented as a file or a partition or is it emulated 
using the regular unix fs?

Access control is another area where it all depends who "we" are.
Right now, we're just kinda sitting around, hanging out, etc.
I mean, if I go to MIT legal and say "me and some unspecified other 
people" want to run ITS on a machine...  That kinda doesn't make sense.  
Of course, I doubt MIT even *cares* about ITS.  And if they were to sue, 
I ask the question "what possible damages could they collect". 

Hell, I wrote the original WEBSTER program when I was working at the AI 
Lab, using a tape of Webster's 9th Collegiate that I got from some folks 
at SPEECH.  Even in this case where there were clearly intellectual 
property issues, things got worked out.  People put up WEBSTER servers 
and it was kind of neat. I don't believe anyone went to jail :-)

>I would love to be able to coordinate this, but feel like I'm already
>too much of a bottleneck (even prior to daddyhood).

Once your KS emulator is available in source form and with an appropriate 
license you will have given an incredibly important piece of the puzzle.
Like I said, what's it worth to you? (when you are able to sell rights).

I'll see what I can do to make it worth your while. Somebody accused me 
of not thinking programmers should make money!  HAHAHAHAHAHA!!  I wrote a 
data collection system for the IRS and happily cashed the checks (and 
paid taxes on the income, btw ;-)  So don't paint me as some radical who 
can't understand making money.  This is a special case, and the "right 
thing" in this case is to make ITS freely available and sharable. Hoorah.

Hell, I'd settle for competent TTY handling and a decent implementation 
of SEND/REPLY/FR.

Let's get it on.

Marty -

I respectfully suggest that your comments are not helpful and come remarkably
close to the "warez" mentality.

KLH's decisions and policies with respect to his emulator are his to make, and
I think that your remarks were uncalled-for.  If you don't like his decisions
and policies, you can use some other emulator.  Stu Grossman's emulator will
at least start TOPS-20 on some platforms.  I fear that Dan Seagraves has a
long way to go yet; he's just solved the easy problems.  Or you can write your
own, and see exactly how nasty the problem is.

I was particularly offended by your "what have you done" comment to KLH.  The
same might be said about everyone else after the late 1970s when ITS died.  It
remained a great playground afterwards, and people did a lot of work getting
it to run on the KS and to implement TCP (KLH did a lot of that work), but
nothing of any significance was done to ITS technology in the 80s to keep it
viable.

Let's be honest; people stopped doing serious work on ITS after the 70s.  It's
sad and unfortunate that it happened, but it did.  People did serious work on
TOPS-20 in the early 80s (and there were good reasons why TOPS-20 outlasted
ITS) but after about 1987 or 1988 TOPS-20 was equally moribund -- although
remnants persisted into the mid-90s.

This happened because each and every one of us made a personal decision to put
our efforts elsewhere.  Even RMS gave up on ITS fairly early on; he now
supports an operating system whose security policies are far more fascist than
TOPS-20.

These decisions were unfortunate, but they were correct.  I don't think that
it's appropriate to beat up on people for having made those decisions.

With regard to the status of ITS, MIT *has* shown considerable interest and
property ownership rights in ITS technology in the past.  As I recall, MIT had
to be sued to extract Macsyma from them.  Let's not forget Lisp machine
architecture and software.

My own dealings with MIT in another context suggests that it is extremely
prudent to get all the t's crossed and i's dotted.  I don't think that I can
discuss my horror story as it was eventually settled in my favor.  Just let's
say that there are individuals at MIT who will go to ridiculous lengths in
pursuit of the almighty dollar.

We must also consider what the law says.  The law is quite clear about
ownership rights, and it's not in our favor.  It doesn't give a damn that ITS
had no file protections, or that you wrote a Webster server and nobody did
anything.

People who have homes and families and investments and retirement accounts
have to think about whether they are setting themselves up to be taken to the
cleaners by some greedy lawyer.  They may be personally pleased that someone
is willing to flout these unreasonable laws and otherwise tilt at windmills.
But you can't blame them for not doing so themselves.

Unless they published it without a copyright notice prior to March
1986, it's under copyright protection.  Whether anyone wants money is
irrelevant.  It's not your property.

Nor do I claim it is mine (or yours, or any other individual'sfor that 
matter). I do claim however that title is ambiguous, and that there is 
some reasonable chance that much of ITS would be arguably public without 
too much of a legal battle.

ITS would run without LISPM sources, MACSYMA sources, and lots of other 
stuff. The question becomes, how to seperate it, and how to determine 
what is what.

Sheesh, we got world-class compiler writers, internet deities, and living 
legends, and we can't take the time to go through a filesystem and 
sanitize it enough to make it pass legal muster?

We got Minsky, Sussman, TK, and presumably Winston available to get legal 
to lean our way and we can't get this done?? 

I dunno Pat, but this is really sounding like this is about something 
else besides bringing up ITS.

How about we start talking more about how to get this done rather than 
how we can lose.

Hm. Getting kinda warm in here.

I just thought I'd chime in to mention that the present management of 
the MIT Technology Licensing Office has explicitly stated a set of 
priorities that don't necessarily put making old things as widely 
available as possible at the top of the list.

Some of us have had difficult experiences with the TLO in the past, 
but in general their claim then was that their highest priority was 
to spread knowledge widely. Now, this is less true at the policy 
level, and it's being reflected down into specific decisions fairly 
strongly. This has created some battles between the TLO and 
individual faculty, and the ability of the faculty to influence 
things is less than it was. I'd be a little bit careful about how I 
framed an approach to them, and unfortunately I agree with Mark about 
crossed t's and dotted i's.

Mark, I respect your right to disagree. I think your views come

Once again, you're entitled to your opinion.

You say that as if it's the only option.  Think again. and again. and 
again.

The context of those remarks was that KLH implied that RMS was the only 
person that felt that the GPL was a valid, important, and appropriate 
tool for some software.  His suggestion that RMS was the only person that 
felt that way was, in my view, offensive. Millions of people have 
benefited from the GPL, many of them programmers.

If that offended you, then so be it.  I don't agree with everything RMS 
says, but where I do, I will speak out, even in a room where it might not 
be the "popular" thing to say. You do the same thing.

Geez. And how about the fact that ITS didn't run on hardware that a 
normal person could afford. And that the documentation was in 20 heads 
that no longer worked for the lab. I guess Lisp Machine companies didn't 
work out because "each of us made a personal decision to put our efforts

You must mean the Hurd.  An OS where every user can patch the running OS 
and change its behaviour.  You should visit gnu.org more often. You're 
not paying attention.

Correct as in "Mark Crispin agrees with them". Yeah. got it.

Hey, what's done is done.  I'm in fact trying to get people to deal with 
what's really going on rather than going into some UCODE discussion that 
3 people can understand to mask the fact that this is about guys with 
world-class egos who would rather point at the obstacles.  You think it's 
not?  Come on, be honest.
And maybe it's their right to.  Consider this an invitation to "think

As previously noted, ITS could run without lotsa stuff like that.  And 
w.r.t. MIT, let's at least ask the questions before we jump to 
conclusions.
Obviously this would take some work, but so far I don't even know who the 
players here are.  I suspect most people would donate their code 
willingly, and I think that if a few AI Lab icons backed our play, 
declared the filesystem clean, and spoke to legal, we could get the o.k.

That's what you want, right?  To see ITS up again? yes? :-)

Well, Mark, I'm simply shocked.  I mean, you're well-known as Mr. Tact

Lol, in a world where O.J. walks and Ken Starr spends 10*N Million on an 
"investigation", your speculations about the "law" are so very comforting 
:-)

You've been talking to C compilers too long, my friend.  Things get done 
in many ways, and there's a lot of "discretion" available, if you know 
where to find it and how to use it. The use of the pronoun "it" suggests 
that there is some singular arbiter and standard.  Oh friend, I hope you 
really don't believe this.

You watch a lot of TV, don't you?  Few people get to litigation unless 
there's something valuable enough to litigate about.  Your sweeping 
bombastic generalizations are not useful in this context.  So far, it 
appears only minimal effort has been applied.  I think with a bit more, 
and with the help of certain AI Lab alumni, we can get an ITS that runs 
and with MIT's blessing.
Matter of fact it'd be fun to be negotiating about directories... I mean, 
let's see "How about this directory for $1000 and that directory for 
$2000".

Whatever.  You can pretend this is about legalities, family 
responsibilities, and you can call me what you like, but I said it before 
and I'll say it again: The technical part of this project is a single 
digit percentage compared to people not wishing to bruise their egos.

Which filesystem?  From what date? With what directories? Sheesh, I'm 
betting MIT Legal will ask the AI Lab/LCS to examine any prospective 
filesystem for valuation/cleanliness, etc.  

Understanding _who decides_ is important in getting the decision you 
want, which is why juries are profiled, and surveys are taken.

Ascent.com. Who started that company?  Hmmm, you wouldn't by any chance 
be working for a company that's using code that was developed in whole or 
in part by folks who at one time worked at the AI Lab, would you? 

Geez, Pat, if I'm a conspiracy theorist, you're Pollyanna's first born. 

(if my memory serves, ascent.com was started by a former AI Lab director 
with the purpose of using AI technology in high-end applications. If 
memory further serves, another principal was his assistant.)

By that standard, you are a sellout because you aren't you running a public
ITS KS on the Internet.  Why didn't you rescue the AI or MC KS, find a place
for it, install power, a/c, and Internet link?

How DARE you cast calumny on people who've worked damn hard to preserve what
they could, often at great personal expense?  I have spent many thousands of
dollars of private funds to keep the flame of PDP-10s (including ITS) dimly
lit at Panda, and to conserve much more; not to mention the assistance of
Messrs J. Dempster and P. Lothberg who also put extensive money and time into
the effort.

I did not read that implication.  I read that the GPL could not be applied
retroactively by people who do not have legal ownership; and that in the
absence of explicit releases we have to assume the worst.

My discussions with RMS rather strongly suggest that he believes that the GPL
is the only valid, important, and appropriate tool for all software.  He has
made it quite clear that he believes that the license used by my employer is
invalid, unimportant, and inappropriate.  He went on quite a crusade a few
years ago to badmouth my employer in public on this issue.

> Geez. And how about the fact that ITS didn't run on hardware that a

Bullshit.  They were practically giving away KS systems in the late 80s and
early 90s.  The electric bill for a KS is about $100/month.

So where were you?  Maybe you didn't really care all that much.

> And that the documentation was in 20 heads

So why didn't you write it all down?

Don't people have a right to go to work someplace else?  What about all the
people who left years earlier, e.g. Don Eastlake, Jeff Rubin, Alan Kotok, Pete
Samson, Stew Nelson, Bill Gosper?  You're complaining about the departure of
(at least) the fourth generation of ITS hackers.

> I guess Lisp Machine companies didn't

Lisp Machine companies worked out for a while, and some people did quite well
as a result.  It turned out in subsequent years that mass-produced general
purpose processors could run Lisp with much better price/performance than
dedicated machines.

That has nothing to do with individual actions.  The market for Lisp simply
did not provide the funding required to keep up with the killer micros.  Intel
probably spends more in R&D in a single day than was ever earned by all Lisp

OK.  I tried to connect to gnu.org so I could do f^K, rms^F, ^R rms;rms mail,
and then maybe mrc$u.  Here is the result:

% telnet gnu.org
Trying 158.121.106.20...
Connected to gnu.org.
Escape character is '^]'.
telnetd: Authorization failed.
Please contact request@gnu.org for information on using kerberos
Connection closed by foreign host.

Hmm.  Even TOPS-20 let me do FINGER and SYSTAT and INFORMATION commands
without logging in.  This fancy gnu.org gives me this fascist "authorization
failed" and tells me that I need to learn about Kerberos.

Correct as in what was right for them.

Only a fanatic tells people that they must sacrifice home and family for a
dead cause.

No, you are pissing people off, and are pissing me off to the point that I am
about to unsubscribe from ITS-LOVERS.  KLH asked me if I would help out on
this project, but if I have to deal with you being a world-class asshole then
I'm punting.

That's a lot of people who need to be talked with; who *ARE* being talked
with.  I gave my consent for the contents of MRC;.  Unfortunately, it also
involves levels at MIT which have not been particularly responsive, but
nonetheless have to be asked.

I see that there isn't a MARTY; directory on either the AI or the MC final
dump.  So you didn't stick around after all.

You don't know what the hell you are talking about.

MIT solicited me for a donation for a project.  I, and many others, responded
with a cash donation payable to the project.  MIT subsequently decided that
they did not want to be involved with that project, unilaterally broke the
contact, but kept the donations.

It took a considerable period of time before those donations were pried out of
MIT and forwarded to the new home of the project at another university.

The project in question is very well-known today.  Some people may have put
two and two together; but nothing's to be gained in dredging this up any
further.

As an institution, MIT is not ill-willed.  However, like many other large
organizations, MIT has its little empires, any of which can waste a lot of
one's time and money.

If you wish to put your net worth at risk, that is your business.  You have no
right to demand that anyone else do so.

Earlier this year, the above-named project came out of litigation aimed at
destroying it.  You don't know the extent to which a single crank can turn

You keep on making this accusation with no evidence.

The only ego in this is yours.  You seem to think that you're the only person
who care or has done anything, and that this gives you the right to insult
everybody else.

You mean technology licensing.  A better bet is that they don't want to deal

It ain't so, but you sure as hell aren't evidencing that spirit.  If you were,
you would take the time to learn the facts before flinging around baseless
accusations.

Three points:

1) I would prefer all this flaming stop.  That we get back to ITS.
And for requests for help from ITS hackers to make ITS widely available.

   From: Mark Crispin <MRC@cac.washington.edu>

   ...

   My discussions with RMS rather strongly suggest that he believes
   that the GPL is the only valid, important, and appropriate tool for
   all software.  

2)

True.

                  He has made it quite clear that he believes that the
   license used by my employer is invalid, unimportant, and
   inappropriate.  He went on quite a crusade a few years ago to
   badmouth my employer in public on this issue.

   ...

Mark:

These two sentences are a gross over-simplification of what has
happened (and when I last checked a few months ago) still happening
between the FSF and your "employer".  It is also mis-leading and MOST
UNFAIR to the FSF and rms.

If you are going to be this biased, it's fair to say so.

3) Can we please get back to ITS now?

Can everyone please just stop the flaming?

Once again, I respectfully disagree with your opinions on this matter.

Perhaps the subtlty of what I've done has been lost on you, Mark. 
See how much focus there is now? :-)

If you're ever in town I'd be happy to discuss my thoughts over a meal.

Matter of fact, who's up for a group at Mary's/Royal East sometime?

I live just a few blocks from there, and it sounds like there are quite a 
few people are still in the area.

Perhaps a new mailing list (its-politics@mc.lcs.mit.edu) could be
developed?  Or maybe this flame fest will die down after a little
while and we can all work together to get this machine up, figure
out exactly how we are going to manage it, what we will tell the
press (depending on who cares) and in general how to make this all
come together...

I think that its-lovers could be the right place for this.

if a fair number people disagree and would rather NOT see this 
traffic here, and would prefer it on it's own list, send me 
personal mail and I'll create its-politics@mc.lcs.mit.edu,
and announce it here.

Again, this is only if you love ITS, but don't care about the politics,
and would rather it be on a separate list.

   if a fair number people disagree and would rather NOT see this 
   traffic here, and would prefer it on it's own list, send me 
   personal mail and I'll create its-politics@mc.lcs.mit.edu,
   and announce it here.

Well, put it this way.  I would prefer to see this flamage voluntarily
move to some list that I'm not on so that I can remove the procmail
rule I just added to file anything from, to, or cc Marty automatically
into the delete-unread-after-two-weeks folder along with mail from Bob

I wish to publicly apologize for some of the things I have said, and 
especially how I have said them on this list.  I will send private mail 
to some individuals, but I wanted to send public mail in case I don't 
catch everyone.

I have some very strong feelings about ITS and about the AI Lab and MIT 
in general, and sometimes I express myself badly where these subjects are 
concerned. A re-reading of some of the things I said has helped me to 
recognize and face some unresolved issues I need to deal with.  I could 
have expressed myself much more diplomatically and constructively, while 
making my points known.

I still feel the goal of getting a public ITS machine up is a worthy one, 
and I still wish to help.  Hopefully this message will be a step in the 
right direction.

Well, my only real goal is getting an ITS up that can be accessed
by the public - just as it was in the past, those who are easily
distracted will come and go, and those who find something of interest
will stay, and learn and maybe even make it better.  Anything that
furthers that goal is good, as long as it is not screwing someone
or something as a side-effect.

I knew that bringing back ITS would open old wounds as well as
wonderful memories.  Same as it ever was.   Still, to get to the
good people may have to plow through some of the bad.  Hopefully
the passage of time can help people see things with more perspective.

In any case, this will take the effort of many, because none of us
can do it anywhere near full time.  Volunteer efforts are always
difficult and strained.  We need people to "run" the machine, and
we even need to define what "run" means.  Lots to do eh?  ;-)

Quite a dilemma. I can hardly stop beating her, since I don't yet have
her...

Does that mean you'll stop right away, or that you'll never grow up?

Does anyone have an docs on line for any of the following devices:

CH10 Chaosnet interface
CH11 Chaosnet interface
ACC LH/DH Interface
Whatever the KL10 used to connect to an IMP (did it use an AN10?)
PDP11 Chaos-Ethernet gateway (used on MC?)

Anyone trying to run ITS under some kind of emulation will probably
eventually need to deal with these devices....

I know I could just go read the code, but it would be nice to have some
docs in hand as well, if there are any on-line.

Peripherally related, is there anywhere one can find a copy of BBN Report
1822 on line?  I used to have a hardcopy, but I've misplaced it over the
course of several moves ...  Since BBN was taken over by GTE, I am not
sure I could even send away for another copy anymore.

We did not use an AN10.  I think the IMP interface was in one corner of 
the KL-UDGE board.  That's just my memory, I have not confirmed it from 
any written sources.

The code is more likely to be accurate.

    >> Whatever the KL10 used to connect to an IMP (did it use an AN10?)

None of the ITS machines used an AN-10, AFAICR. I don't recall all the
details, but I know DM had a home-rolled interface (which used some really
ugly kludges with the isolation, but I digress).

    > We did not use an AN10. I think the IMP interface was in one corner of

I'm pretty sure it was via the KL-UDGE, but whether the interface was a
(logical) replica of the one on the KA's, or whether it was a whole new design
(I suspect the latter), I haven't a clue. (I can tell you that IIRC it used
the LH IMP interface electrical spec, and I'm pretty sure all the KA's used
the DH, but that's not very useful! :-)

If anyone's noticed, I kinda dropped off the face of the earth recently.
I haven't had time to touch e10 for several weeks.  I really am gonna miss
my Y2K mark now, but hopefully not by far.

Anyway, the problem was (and still is) my stepdad.  For the last few weeks
he'd been acting funny.  He'd hurt his back somehow, and the pain was so
bad he was barely able to walk.  This progressed until thursay last week,
when it got so bad he was having trouble breathing.  He was due in the
hospital anyway the next day for examination prior to knee-replacement
surgery, so we took him in.  This took a lot of doing, he's a proud man
and doesn't want anyone to know if he's sick.

Anyway, X-rays showed lumps in his lungs.  CAT scan says they're cancer.
They opened him up to do a biopsy, but they couldn't - the breathing
trouble turned out to be pneumonia.  So they put him in a hospital room,
shot him full of drugs and such, and got that cleared up Wednesday.
Yesterday they did the biopsy.  I haven't been given official results yet,
but my mom said the guy told her it was lung cancer, caught at a
semi-early stage, that they can try killing it, but if they fail, he has a
year and a half, tops.  (No pun intended.)

He did smoke, he stopped about 5 years ago.  Apparently it wasn't fast
enough.  Of course, it isn't helping my mother in the least when my kid
brother (18) smokes in front of her.  He claims he's got one life and
plans on getting it over with.  I plan to beat some sense into him
(hopefully I won't get arrested) if he doesn't straighten up.

Anyway, this whole thing has turned into a large mess and soaked up my
hacking time.  Sorry.  I do plan to get things back on track sometime
soon, but obviously this takes precedence.  I might post a tarball of what
I've got at home, that would be tonight or tomorrow maybe.

Can someone provide a brief overview of what (aside from ITS paging) was
changed in the DEC microcode to make ITS work?  Including, but not
necessarily limited to:

    CIRC instruction  (which I can't seem to find anything that uses)
    One-Proceed    (ditto - I'm guessing this is for single-stepping)
    PC Sample Table    (for profiling)
    ITS IO instructions   (how are these different from standard DEC
                           KS10 IO instructions)

Thanks,
--Pat.

I don't know about ITS, but my support for DECnet Phase IV uses CIRC T1,-1 as
a faster way of doing IDIVI T1,2.  I was also planning on rewriting the bit
reversing code to use CIRC ac,44 but I never got around to it.

Was CIRC generally available on the KL10, or just at MIT??

Just MIT and Panda.

I also added XJRST to Panda's microcode.

What I heard about CIRC was that it was done on the AI KA-10
because it was easy (hardwarily) and fun.  The only "serious"
use it got came years later, when it was used to reverse the
bits of an image for the XGP (Xerox Graphics Printer), which
was connected to a PDP-11 which in turn was connected to AI.

DM and ML did not have CIRC.

The implementation on MIT-MC's KL 10 was solely for hack
value, as far as I know.

CIRC was also on the KS.  I got the microcode for CIRC from the ITS microcode.

DEC also added two really neat instructions for people doing Unibus hacking,
BLTUB and BLTBU, "B" meaning "byte" and "U" meaning "Unibus".  I also made the
KDP driver for the DECnet Phase IV code use it.

files kicking around in some ITS image?  (And any

It looks like FONTS;25VQXB KST, FONTS;25VCTL KST, FONTS;5x7 KST, and
FONTS1;25VQXZ KST made it onto the final ITS dump.  I haven't a clue if these
are XGP or Dover fonts, I never was a font hacker.

There's also FONTS:QUUX-F KST  ... ;-)

I don't know if the UNIX format files that I have of these are any good.  The
ASCII files were on the CD-ROM as PDP-10 5x7 => UNIX 4x8, so if that happened
to the binary files then bit 35 (1.1 for ITS old farts) would be lost.
Presumably, someone has a better version.  I'm willing to send you a tarball
of what I have if you like.

I squirrled away some copies of the KST files some time ago (it looks
like around 1994).  They're compressed files.  I once tried, not long
ago, to convert them to AST format using the font code on a LispM, but
I think I ran into byte-size issues or format issues -- it didn't
work, and I didn't have time to investigate too far.  I've looked
around for the definition of KST format, with no luck.  Anyway, I can
get the compressed KST files to you, and if you find a method of
converting them to AST or other usable formats, I'd be very
interested.

    I don't know if the UNIX format files that I have of these are any good.  The
    ASCII files were on the CD-ROM as PDP-10 5x7 => UNIX 4x8, so if that happened
    to the binary files then bit 35 (1.1 for ITS old farts) would be lost.
    Presumably, someone has a better version.  I'm willing to send you a tarball
    of what I have if you like.

I don't have the fonts that Guy is looking for, but it did remind
me of one of my quests.

Does anyone know what the default font for the Xerox Dover was?
it was _something_ serif, but I've never been able to recreate 
exactly what it was, and I don't have typography weenies around when
some of my old output tends to surface.

The default Dover font (at least, as seen on the the CMU CS departments
pair o' Dovers) was the most pleasant output I've ever seen.  I've seen
similar output from MIT's Dovers, but I have no proof that the font
I like was the default (though I believe it was...)

Given that my postscript printer has significantly more processing capability,
and memory, there's no reason why Dover output can't be simulated....

I don't have the fonts, but here is a copy of .INFO.;FED ORDER -

CAVEAT: Several bugs in the description of KST format have been
fixed, by EBM, 11/10/79.  I looked carefully at the source code
for FED and XGPSPL, and tested things out to verify the fixes,
but naturally cannot take complete responsibility since I did
not write the programs.

				   by
		   Joseph D. Cohen and J. Pitts Jarvis

				Abstract
This memo  describes FED,  a program  used for  compiling and  inspecting
fonts;  AST  font format, a text  format which can be  used to create and
edit fonts;  and KST font format, the binary format used by SCRIMP,  TJ6,
PUB, R, and SCRIBE.

Work  reported  herein  was  conducted  at  the  Artificial  Intelligence
Laboratory, a  Massachusetts  Institute of  Technology  research  program
supported  in  part  by  the Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  of the
Department of Defense and monitored by the Office of Naval Research under
Contact number N00014-70-A-0362-0005.

Working Papers are informal papers intended primarily for internal use.


FED and Font Formats________________2__Font Editor and Console Operation.

FED, the Font "EDitor"

FED  is  a  program  used  for  compiling  and  inspecting  fonts.    FED
understands the following font formats:
	AST -- text format which can be used to create and edit fonts  in
		TECO;
	KST  -- MITAI and CMU compiled font format, used by programs like
		SCRIMP, TJ6, and PUB;
	CMU -- a newer compiled CMU format;
	CU -- the newest compiled CMU format;
	FNT -- SAIL compiled font format;  and
	XH -- Xerox PARC compiled font format.
FED reads all formats, but writes only AST and KST.

FED asks for an input file name.  If the second name is AST, KST, FNT, or
XH, FED assumes the input file to be in the appropriate format.   If  the
second name is something else, FED asks what FORMAT the input file is in.
If  the file name  is blank, FED  kills itself.   FED reads  the file and
types out various decimal data.   A FIXED width font is one in which  the
CHARACTER  WIDTH of all  defined characters is the  same as the CHARACTER
WIDTH of a space.  FED calls all other fonts VARIABLE width.

FED tries  to display  the font  on the  user's terminal,  if it's  a  TV
display;  or  on the 340, if the user is near there, and the 340 and PDP6
are available.   FED displays as  though one XGP  dot equals one  display
dot,  so the  size and proportion  of the font  will be distorted.   (200
horizontal XGP  dots  =  1  inch, 192  vertical  dots  =  1  inch.   ~108
horizontal 340 dots = ~108 vertical 340 dots = 1 inch.  ~58 horizontal TV
display dots = 1 inch.  ~57 vertical TV display dots = 1 inch.  A TV font
display  will therefore be enlarged 4 diameters over the same font on the
XGP.)

FED then offers  to write  out the font.   If  you type  N, FED  restarts
itself;  if  you  type  Y, it  asks  for  the output  file  name;  and if
anything else is typed, it repeats its offer.  If you write the file, FED
will offer  to compact  the raster.   (This  is a  horizontal  compaction
accomplished by eliminating leading and trailing blank columns.)   If you
type Y, FED will compact the raster as much as possible, and tell you how
many words the compaction will save in the XGP's PDP11. When  compacting,
FED  will also let you  know if there are  any characters whose raster is
wider than the defined raster  width.   The input default system name  is
FONTS,  the output  default system name  is the  job's SNAME.   Input and
output default second file name is KST.

Please do not write new fonts onto the FONTS directory -- it is almost
full.  Absolutely do not modify fonts on the FONTS directory.  All
concerned programs are perfectly capable of reading fonts from your very
own directory.  The reason for this injunction is that it has been
determined, after much experimentation, that the definition of
"improvement" is consistently a local variable.  Please keep your
"improvements" to yourself.

A  typical  FED  console  session  looks  as  follows:  (User  typein  is
underlined,  is a carriage return.)

AST Font Format

The AST font format is a text format which can be used to create and edit
fonts in TECO.   An AST file has one  page of font data, followed by  one
page  of character data for  each defined character.   All numbers except
CHARACTER CODE are decimal.   It is the order of the numbers, rather than
the  text   identification  after   them,  that   FED  looks   at.    The
identification is merely a convenience.

The file's first page is font data and looks like:
n KSTID dev:dir;file name
n HEIGHT
n BASE LINE
n COLUMN POSITION ADJUSTMENT

KSTID  is a  currently unimplemented  feature.   It is  intended to  be a
	unique number for each font so  that PDP11 will know which  fonts
	are  loaded, and not  do unnecessary reloads.   KSTID  is used by
	CMU.   (KSTID should be set to 0.)  FED writes, on every page  of
	the  output AST file, the file name of the source font file.   On
	input FED ignores the file name data in AST files.
HEIGHT is the height of all characters in XGP raster lines.
BASE LINE is the location of the character base line in XGP raster  lines
	from  the top of all characters.   (The  base line is used by the
	XGP  underscore  command.    See  Working  Paper  #72,  XGP Font
	Catalog.)
COLUMN POSITION ADJUSTMENT is an artifact.  It is a number which is added
	to the LEFT KERN  of each character to  get its total left  kern.
	To  be SAIL compatible,  COLUMN POSITION ADJUSTMENT  should be 0,
	and all kerning sould be included in individual character data.

The rest of  the file  is one  page of  character data  for each  defined
character.  Each page looks like:
n CHARACTER CODE
n RASTER WIDTH
n CHARACTER WIDTH
n LEFT KERN
 *   *
  * *
   *
  * *
 *   *

CHARACTER CODE is the octal ASCII code of the character.
RASTER  WIDTH is the width of the raster in XGP dots.   It is a good idea
	to make the raster width as  small as possible, in order to  save
	space  in font files,  and to allow  the XGP PDP11  to store more
	fonts.  A leading blank column can be flushed if RASTER WIDTH and
	LEFT KERN are decremented.  Trailing blank columns can be flushed
	by simply decrementing RASTER  WIDTH.   (The FED compact  feature
	does this automatically.)
CHARACTER  WIDTH is the amount, in XGP dots, that printing this character
	will  advance  the  line  postion.   This  number  is  completely
	independent  of RASTER  WIDTH, and  LEFT KERN.   For  example, if
	CHARACTER  WIDTH<RASTER  WIDTH,  characters  will  overlap.    If
	CHARACTER WIDTH>RASTER WIDTH, there  will be extra blank  columns
	in the character.   How many appear on each side is determined by
	LEFT KERN.
LEFT KERN (plus COLUMN POSITION ADJUSTMENT, if any) is the amount to move
	left from the logical left  end of the character before  printing
	the raster.  (Positive left kern means move left;  negative, move
	right.)
*  is any printing character used  to define the CHARACTER RASTER.   Each
	raster row is represented by  a text line.   If a space  appears,
	the  bit is off  in the raster, if  a printing character appears,
	the bit is  on.   Carriage return  terminates the  text row,  and
	implies  blanks  for  the  rest  of  the  raster  row.   Formfeed
	terminates the raster, and  implies trailing blank raster  lines.
	The  first row  is the  top row.   Information  wider than RASTER
	WIDTH is ignored.

KST Font Format

KST is  CMU's  oldest  and  MITAI's only  compiled  binary  font  format.
SCRIMP,  TJ6, PUB,  and other  programs all use  KST files  as their font
definitions.  KST format is as follows:
Word 0/ KSTID
Word 1/ 9 bits COLUMN POSITION ADJUSTMENT, 9 bits BASE LINE,,HEIGHT
The remainder of the file has one block of data for each character.  Each
block looks like:
	USER ID ;not currently used but  low order bit is on.   This  bit
		can  be used to find the  beginning of a new block.   The
		last block is followed by two -1's.
	LEFT KERN,,CHARACTER CODE
	RASTER WIDTH,,CHARACTER WIDTH
	CHARACTER MATRIX
The character matrix is stored four  8-bit bytes per word, so that  ILDBs
with  8-bit byte size get successive bytes.  The remaining four low order
bits are 0.   The bits are reversed in each byte (because of the way  the
XGP  interface  works)  so that  the  high  order (leftmost)  bit  of the
character is the low order bit of the byte.   The matrix is stored row by
row;  rows  follow  one another with no extra separating bytes.  The last
word is filled out with 0 bytes, if necessary.  Note that HEIGHT rows are
stored for each character, and (RASTER WIDTH + 7)/8 bytes  are  used  for
each row.

Some  old MIT KST  files, and all CMU's  KST files do  not use the RASTER
WIDTH variable.  (All characters have RASTER WIDTH=CHARACTER WIDTH.)  The
third word  of those  files  has 0  in  the left  half.   Programs  which
directly  examine KST files for RASTER  WIDTH should therefore, if RASTER
WIDTH=0, use CHARACTER WIDTH instead.   (Note  that this also means  that
while  MITAI can use  CMU's KST files,  CMU cannot use  MITAI KST files.)
Since when RASTER WIDTH=0, MITAI programs substitute CHARACTER WIDTH, you
should not write a program which will set RASTER WIDTH to zero.  When FED
finds a character with  zero RASTER WIDTH, FED  will write the  character
with  RASTER WIDTH=1. This does  not waste any space  in the XGP's PDP11,
since the PDP11 does  a vertical compaction  of rasters, eliminating  top
and bottom blank lines.

Odds and End

The  KST,  FNT,  XH,  and  FED   internal  formats  are  listed  in   the
extravagantly commented FED source file (stored on the SYSENG directory).
FED  also  has  extensive  comments on  programming  the  PDP10  to PDP11
interface.  FED was written by Pitts Jarvis, with additions by Joe Cohen.
Brian Harvey is responsible for  SAIL font hackery, whose  specifications
and fonts we copied.

Fonts  are stored on the FONTS;  directory,  and are described in Working
Paper #72, XGP Font Catalog, by Tom Knight.

The source file for  this memo is  WP;FED 78Wn, where  n is the  revision
number.

They are probably in Alan Bawden's clever format which maps ITS text to 
Unix text but also preserves all the bits in ITS binary.  If you see a 
Unix byte in the range 360-377 ascii, its low 4 bits are the high 4 bits 
of a pdp-10 word, and the next four Unix bytes are the remaining 32 bits. 
 I don't seem to have documentation on this format, but I do have a 
program that can read it, and FED which can convert KST to AST.

How come I didn't get one of those CD-ROMs?

FWIW, the format is documented in comment blocks in my ITSTAR program:

	ftp://ftp.dbit.com/pub/pdp10/its/itstar/unpack.c

The program's purpose is to translate between the UNIX format (8-bit-ish)
and the TM03 tape format (five frames per word), but the data are translated
to/from 36-bit words as an intermediate step so it should be easy to slice
out the code you'd need to do some particular translation.

With the FED WP from Dave Moon and code from John Wilson, I was able
to (finally) extract the bits from the fonts!  I've enclosed a
compressed tar archive.  Hope it helps.  Naturally, with some
tweaking, the program I'm using could generate other formats.

I posted this question to info-pdp11 yesterday, but since it was really
prompted by something in ITS, I thought I'd ask here.

I'm having some problems understanding what the MARK routine in NSALV
is doing with sector headers.  Like, suppose you issue a "Read Data and
Headers" command to an RP06, for instance.  What would you be expecting to
come back from the drive?  If you did a "Write Data and Headers", would
you be able to write the same thing you just read?  What about if you did
the same thing on am RM03?  I understand that the headers are slightly
different on that drive.

Thanks,
--Pat.

For RP0x drives at least, it's dependent on whether the pack was formatted
in 16 or 18 bit mode.

The header for RP04s (and maybe more) looks like this:

WORD #		WHAT
1		Cylinder address, and bit 12 is 16/18 bit mode flag
2		Hi order 5 bits - sector, 5 low order bits of upper
		byte = track
3		Keyword 1 - Arbitrary
4		Keyword 2 - Arbitrary
5		CRC word - not available to software

These are 18 bit words here.
There's a pretty good chance I am wrong, so someone correct this if
needed.

My first Year 2000 bug. BABYL apparently had a hard coded search for

Subject: TU77 tape drives, part 2...
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

The saga continues...

This morning I took delivery of a second complete TU77 tape drive.
Turned out to be in fair condition, from a 2060 system, and apparently
with a dead takeup reel circuit. Ah well, nothing is perfect...

However the TM03 formatter was fully operational. I hooked the formatter
up to the 2020, fired up DSTUA diagnostics, and got the same set of
errors (MBCPE: Massbus Control Parity Error) as the first TM03 (and my
spare).

The chances that I have run across 3 dead TM03's are pretty close to
zero. As a result, the problem has got to be in the cabling between the
RH11 and the TM03. Not too suprising since MASSBUS has about a million
wires (well, 120 to be exact) going through several really old
bulkheads.

Question: I'm about ready to chuck the whole MASSBUS cable thingie and
just go with 3 40pin ribbon cables directly between the TM03's 5903
cards and the drivers on the RH11. Will this work? I know about signal
issues, but I'm only going a total of 10-12 feet, and the damn things
are terminated...

At least it looks like the drive is good. Hey, when I get this going I
could actually sit around and dup tapes (assuming my power meter at the
house doesn't explode). The good news on all of this is that I am
getting closer to getting the drive fixed, and ITS online again.

... except in this case.  I bet anything Mr. Murphy will pay you a visit. ^_^

Also, what was with the TOPS-10 guys saying you couldn't hook tapes and
disks on the same MASSBUS?  Are you sure that's not correct?

Also, is it possible to hook the drive and tape in the opposite order?
(Tape first and then drive?)

Wait, I think I have a MASSBUS cable.  I'll have to try looking Monday.

Also, do you know that the terminator is good?

I dunno.  Don't they have odd endings on them?
Have you taken a VOM and stuck it on the lines?

Closer than I am at least.  I've still got general odd happenings going on
with the RH10/DF10 and anything involving running with the pager /
interval timer turned on...  (I should have a workable code update
sometime next week though, so others can argue with this too.)

Hey, KLH, how's your project coming along?

No holy wars intended, but this was downright hilarious (to me at
least...)

My bedroom is a dump, as you might well imagine... I share it with my
brother.  He makes most of the mess.  Anyway, we have 2 of those
hospital-style beds, the kind you can crank up and down.  Mine is cranked
nearly all the way up so I can fit my PDP11 under there.  It's an 11/83,
with a single RL02, runs RSTS 7.0-07.  Badly, because my RL02 pack is
starting to develop bad sectors.  My PC serves as the console - It's in a
sort-of pile on the floor in front of the RL02.  You ever seen those grey
luggable cases with the LCD panel on the front, they usually had PC-XT
style gear in them?  I have one of those cases.  But my machine is too big
for the case, and I'm far to lazy to go get a real case, so instead, I
have it sitting LCD-down, with the CD-ROM, floppy drive, and one of the
harddisks (The one for Win95.  I normally run Linux.) sitting outside and
on top of the case.  The top cover is gone.

Anyway, Saturday, my mother decides she's going to clean the room while
I'm at work.  This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely
regarded as a bad move.  (Yes, that was a Hitchiker's refrence.)  Anyway,
I was trying to move a whole bunch of stuff from one Win2k server to a
newer Win2k server.  (BTW, Win2k sucks MUCH less than NT4, but it still
sucks.)  So my stepdad calls here, and demands that I leave off whatever
I'm working on to come home and help my mother clean.  (He's now well
enough to harass me over the phone as well as when I'm at home.)  I told
him that I couldn't, seeing as I had what was once the main server for New
Horizons (The computer-training company I now work for.  But I still work
at UMTech.  The details are really odd, and so I'll leave them out.) apart
on the floor in front of me.  So he gets really mad and hangs up.  Then he
goes upstairs (He can climb stairs now too) to shout at my brother and my
mom.  Surprise, my brother has split, he went to work too.  (Applebees.)
So he gets mad.  First thing he sees on the floor is my relatively
unprotected computer.  So he winds up and kicks that sucker across the
floor.  Parts scatter and a nice satisfying sound ensues.  He likes that,
so he stomps on it once to make sure it was dead.  The powersupply sparked
out and made smoke until it was unplugged, and the case is pretty smashed,
it looks really dead, but he's not quite satisfied.  (You see, his parents
were a couple Germans who were really big on the psychological-punishment
thing, he was raised to believe that any job which did not involve direct
manual labor was not a "real job".  Well, I'm now 21, and he sees the
computer as the reason I don't have a "real job", and feels it's his
misguided responsibility to fix this.)

Anyway, he's out for a little more silicon blood.  What's the next thing
here?  My VT100 and DECWriter are in the closet...  But there's the
PDP11...  So he takes a shot at the side of the RL02.  Broke his toes.  A
run to the hospltal ensues.

Total damage to PC:  Case smashed, powersupply crushed, keyboard smashed,
and I haven't found the mouse yet, but everything important seems to be
OK.  (I have spares, I've already fixed it.)

Total damage to PDP11:  Well, you can almost see a scuffmark on the side
of the RL02...

PCs are wimpy little things...

The article isn't talking about links (which are old stuff), but rather about
automatically creating them.  It isn't well-known, but NT has always had links
too.  I'm not talking about those kludgy soft links that only Explorer knows
about (grr), I mean real hard links in NTFS.

What's new is that when installing new files, it automatically checks to see
if the file already exists on the filesystem someplace else, and if so, it
makes a link instead of writing a new file.

This is particularly important now that Win2K no longer lets vendors install
DLLs on the system directory (creating the infamous "DLL hell" where a vendor
overwrites a newer DLL with their older one).  The downside is that there can
be a few gazillion copies of some popular VC++ DLLs in various application
directories.

So it is a good idea, and they do have bragging rights what seems to be a new
concept.  Obviously the press release was written by a marketdroid who didn't
fully understand what s/he was writing about.

Give the Evil Empire credit when it's due.  It's scary how many good ideas
they've come up with in recent years.

Um...

I've got an NT system blowing up because it's running out of "paged
pool". Turns out that NT does have system controlled partitions, and the
PP space can never go above 140 or so megabytes in it's little hard
coded partition. Regardless of how much memory you have...

This is the *exact* problem that RSX11M used to have. Waybackwhen RSX's
pool space could become exhausted by someone banging away on the
keyboard during the login prompt. In fact, if you had a long RS232 cable
attached to an 11 and didn't terminate the other end to something, the
cable could pick up RFI and send garbage to the HELO program. This would
exhaust the pool and trash the system.

Replace RFI with "annoying luser futzing with your stack" and you will
see how far we've come.

CZ

Very annoyed at this :-) Wonder if the user partition on NT is called

I think so, but it might depend on the version.  Try control-N.

We made this work on the KS10 -- it had never worked on the other
processors.  I just looked at the Exec DDT source, the command is
definitely ^N.  ($^N and $$^N were not implemented.)

I'm pretty sure it works too.  I definitely recall single-stepping my way
through the Exec-mode implementation of a system call and being amused that
every time I typed ^N on the system console, pending interrupts would be
serviced, device drivers would run, and the scheduler would let other jobs
run, before returning to the job I was debugging, which would run -one-
instruction, and return to exec DDT.

Can someone remind me how one creates a directory on ITS?  At one time, I
had gone through the sources and had figured this out (and had been able
to create a directory for myself on AI - though I should apologize for
that, as I had no particular overriding reason to use up a directory
slot...); as I recall, it had something to do with trying to open a file
with a particular "odd" name, and the act of trying to open this file
created the directory as a side effect ...

Thanks,
--Pat.

short answer:

   DSK:FOO;..NEW. (UDIR)

where FOO is the dir you wish to create.

Now, for extra credit what magic key sequence and location stuff do you 
have to do in order to run PANDA :-)

Here's an oldie but goldie goin' going long and strong coast to coast 
50,000 watts clear channel... Pat, this one's for you :-)

   See the documentation for OPEN.

I know... unfortunately the ITS archives are offline at the moment, and my
paper listings are in storage.  :(

   To create the new directory FOO, open the file DSK:FOO;..NEW. (UDIR).
   I can't believe I remember that.

Thanks... I guess security-through-obscurity still works!

Write the file ..new. (udir) into the non-existent directory.

Hey, don't divulge secrets of 'security through obscurity' (TM?).

A new version of panda (but with almost identical interface, although
from my memory, and my use had been very limited) was written for the
Project MAC (a.k.a. Swiss) machines in the AI lab in 1992 and was in
use until last year, when it was replaced.

Well, I ran into a few screws with mine (Mostly involving the PI system,
the ITS "XCTR" instruction, and the KL accounting timer) that needed a
rewrite to fix, and that's what I'm doing at the moment.

Well, AI and MC are still suffering from TU77 screwage over here. I put
a second TM03 online (I now have 2 with 18 bit fiddlers) and BOTH of
them have been giving me errors on the MASSBUS control bus (parity). I'm
beginning to wonder if the RH11 itself is screwed, instead of the
TM03...

However there is hope. Just a few days ago I finally managed to get my
BA11-Q bus backplane and QUnivertor out of mothballs and into the 20's
BA11-K box. I now have an 11/23+ CPU online in there, along with a nice
RLV11 controller and a Qunivertor hooking up to the RH11.

With this and a copy of RT11, I should be able to sit down and figure
out what the hell is going on with the TU77. TOPS20 diagnostics are not
very helpfull, and if I can troubleshoot this with RSX11 or RT11, I can
finally get the damn ITS tapes to load. This will also give me a chance
to put in another RH11 and try running/formatting the RM80 drive I've
got over here.

Alternate tack: I have a SCSI 9 track magtape reader here attached to a
SGI Indigo chassis (I could probably get a Sun quick if need be) Anyone
have any thoughts on dumping the tapes to a Unix file, then uploading
the file to the 20 via the console monitor and serial port? Sure it
would be slow, but it *would* work.

Any thoughts?
Chris

I remember looking into this a while ago, and IIRC it looked tricky because
the binary file format (SBLK???) loaded by the MTBOOT contains references to
previously loaded memory locations.  So it can't be trivially translated to
an infinite number of console deposit commands, you either need to maintain
an image of KS10 memory, or else you need to do the translation in real time
and issue console examine commands as needed.  Doable, but annoying...

Company I work for has a service contract with a local federal
penitentiary.  We service the Inmate Telephone System (And let me tell
you, getting INTO the prison is a LARGE pain in the ass.  You'd think
they'd be more concerned about people getting OUT, but then again, this is
the government.)  Anyway, they use the acronym ITS.

10-10-00 slipped by us, didn't it?  I was going to announce this on
DEC-10 day, but I couldn't really wait.  Besides, we've got 10-20 day
coming up soon.  As some of you might know, I've got a band that does
some electronic/punk sort of music.  We recorded a song based on the
ending of Alice's PDP-10.  Its more like a commercial I suppose.. but
it brings up alot of questions from fans of our music which allows me
to get on my soap box on what hacking is.

How awful!  Been there -- it's not a _whole_ lot of fun.

At least we have http://www.monster.com and http://www.OperationIT.com to

Subject: KL10 microcode for ITS

Hi all...

Is the source code for the ITS version of the KL10 microcode available for
download anywhere?   I already found the KS10 microcode in a number of 
different places, but not the KL10 microcode anywhere.

If any of you have a copy stashed away somewhere that you'd be willing
to share, I'd appreciate it.  It should be legal to distribute under the
terms of Digital's Personal License for PDP-10 software.

cheers,

Strange, I found it on AI, not on MC.  But never mind.

However, are there any binary RAM files?  All I can find is ULISP RAM,
which isn't exactly in binary format.

Don Lewine tells me that he wrote a KS10 microcode simulator in 1976, and
while he doesn't still have a copy, he thinks there is a chance that
someone at MIT might have kept it.  Any clues on this?  I'd love to find a
copy of it ...

It really is too bad that you were never able to meet him, then.  From my
brief exchange with him, he seems to be under the impression that you guys
had it, and were using it to work on the ITS paging microcode.

He seems to have "switched gears" after he left Data General, and is now
an attorney practicing patent law in Washington state ....

A KS10 micro-machine simulator!?  Damn!  I wish we had known about that in
1984 when we were doing the ITS version of the KS10 microcode.  But alas,
we did all of our debugging using actual KS10s.  (Fortunately, the

no, nobody at MIT ever had a copy.

If all goes well, I will be getting my hands on a KS10 shortly after
Thanksgiving.  Sans disks, of course.  So anyway, I have a few questions
about these with which to harass people...

How badly do these object to having stock PDP-11 UNIBUS cards shoved in
them?  My current plans (yeah, right) are to take the MSCP card I have in
the 11/44 (It talks MSCP at one end and SCSI at the other, but there's a
bug in it that makes it incompatible with 2.11BSD, so in the 11/44 it's
useless) and put it in the KS, then write MSCP drivers for stuff.  I also
have a slew of DZ11s and other UNIBUS toys to play with.

When the machine is initially turned on, it needs to load microcode from
tape, right?  Is the microcode store nonvolatile or does this have to be
done every time?

What's the bottom nonoperating temperature you can hit without damaging
the machine?  I'm in Peoria, IL, and I'm going to New York to get it -
About a 14 hour trip (I hope my truck makes it. ^_^)  I'll probably rent a
U-haul to do it unless I can borrow a trailer - But in either case it's
likely to be an uncovered trailer (and I'll wrap the machine in a couple
tarps). Or would that risk damaging the machine?

Can you talk to the tape drive (read and write blocks) via the 8080
without running microcode?  I might be making my own microcode tapes.

How hard is it to get an RMsomething? ^_^

How badly will the microcode complain if there is no disk drive, or does
it even care?  The actual point of this machine is to be a refrence point
to help make e10 do something useful. (I still can't &#*@$#&$ mark a disk
pack, and I've been toying with various restructures of the thing to make
it work better...)  Running an operating system would be very very nice,
but not essential.

Are there any gotcha's or anything about the machine I should know before
toying with it?  I'd like very much to avoid doing something stupid and
destroying the machine.

I'll probably think of more later...

The following is correct to the best of my knowledge.  Hopefully, someone

Object?  I don't think the machine would care at all.  There's nothing
all that special about the UNIBUS on a KS10.  MIT put ACC LH/DH cards into
their KS10's as IMP interfaces, and that worked just fine.

You will have problems if your controller and disk can not deal in 18-bit
words.  I imagine you could write an OS-level driver that deals with
packing and unpacking stuff into the 8-bit or 16-bit units that your
hardware probably wants to see, but that'd be slow.  You might do better
to try to get something that speaks MASSBUS out one end, and SCSI out the
other (didn't Emulex make something like this?), and even then you have to
make sure it can deal with 18-bit words.

In any case, you would not be able to boot from your MSCP disks without
hacking the 8080 front-end code (which is in PROM or EPROM) - it expects
to boot only from MASSBUS disks and tapes.

Microcode is loaded either from tape, or from the FE filesystem on disk.
The CRAM is volatile, and must at least be reloaded each time the system
is powered on.  I think the front-end wants to reload the CRAM on every
system boot.

I suppose you could by by using the DM and EM front-end commands to
deposit into and examine memory, and by using the DI and EI commands to
do I/O.  You'll also need to set up the UNIBUS map by hand.  The front-end
itself has no commands to read and write arbitrary tape and disk blocks.

Can't imagine it would be that hard.....

The microcode only tells the machine how to execute PDP-10 instructions.
Doesn't care what, if any, I/O devices are on the machine.....

There are a few rules, the only one I can remember right now (possibly
incorrectly) is that DMA is allowed only on NPR cycles, not BRs, but doing
it on a BR would be really weird anyway so you'd be hard-pressed to find
a device that would break this rule.  I think the other rules are similarly
no big deal.

Pat already pointed out the 18-bit problem with the MSCP controller, but if
you don't mind writing an MSCP driver that repacks data in software
(assuming you can spare a buffer for the pack/unpack, and don't mind
abysmal performance), it should be *possible*, just ignore the snickering!

>I also
>have a slew of DZ11s and other UNIBUS toys to play with.

Running DZs on a KS is perfectly normal, there are drivers and everything.
Other stuff ought to be workable too, as long as you take care of the
software side.  Really the big limiting factor is the power supply in the
BA11K, a fully configured KS is usually pretty close to capacity so you
can't blindly fill every slot w/o checking the math first.

>When the machine is initially turned on, it needs to load microcode from

It's extremely volatile (is there such thing as VRAM?), they used notoriously
unreliable Fairchild 93L415 SRAMs whose flakiness led to a patent on the KS10's
soft ECC recovery technique -- if a microcode parity error occurs and the KS
isn't midway through a bus cycle, the 8080A reloads the microcode from disk
and continues where it left off.  An ugly kludge, but it sure beats crashing.

So yes it's reloaded from the boot device (tape or disk) on every boot.

>What's the bottom nonoperating temperature you can hit without damaging
>the machine?

I wouldn't worry about this.  Humidity is a lot more important than
temperature, and anyway 14 hours of almost anything can be forgiven if
you get it some place warm and dry afterwards, to dry it out again.  I
once got *snow* inside some RK07s, but after a little session with some
91% rubbing alcohol and a blow dryer, they ran fine for years.

>(and I'll wrap the machine in a couple
>tarps).

FYI, U-Haul's own tarps are crap.  I tied one around some KSes once and
within 200 miles it was down to ribbons, just from rustling in the wind.
Dunno about other brands...  If you could find an old canvas one for the
outermost layer, that might be a good thing.

>Can you talk to the tape drive (read and write blocks) via the 8080
>without running microcode?  I might be making my own microcode tapes.

Yes, I've done exactly that (with lots of deposit commands keyed in over the
CTY line by a PC).  It's slow going but it works, and at least you can be sure
you have a tape that your particular drive likes.  I think I still have the
command sequence I concocted around here somewhere...  Aha, this looks like it:

LI 3772450		;CS2=cont clr (slv=0)
DI 40
LI 3772472		;TC=1600, 36-bit mode
DI 12000
LI 3772446		;FC=-5000 (2560 tape frames)
DI 173000
LI 3763000		;UMR #00 => phys page 1
DI 40001
LI 3772444		;BA=0 (remapped to 1000)
DI 0
LI 3772442		;WC=-2000 (18-bit words; 1000*36)
DI 176000
LI 3772440		;CS1=WRT FWD
DI 61
LI 3772452		;drive status reg (user types EI to check result)

This assumes you've previously deposited a block worth of tape data in
PDP-10 memory at 1000.

Rewinding looks like this:

LI 3772450
DI 40
LI 3772440
DI 7
LI 3772452

I can't find the script I used to write a tape mark, but I *think* it
should be exactly like above, only change "DI 7" to "DI 27".

>How hard is it to get an RMsomething? ^_^

You mean on purpose, when you want it?  Pretty hard!  But if you forget
about it, one (or more likely a whole string) will drop in your lap when
you least expect it.

>How badly will the microcode complain if there is no disk drive, or does
>it even care?

Not specifically, I think the "boot" and "boot check" commands are the only
things that will notice.  And if your angle on the tapes is just being able
to load ucode for hand tests, you should know that there's a "DC" command
which deposits directly into the CRAM, so you can skip the tape entirely (as
long as you don't mind taking a while to load it serially on every power-up).
Somewhere I've got the details on how to repack the RAM 262 file into 96-bit
words -- IIRC the actual on-disk format is broken into 12-bit pieces (with
a little padding?) because that's convenient for the hardware, so you just
need to tack that together in the right order.

There's no such animal as a "TS file", it's just a naming convention
for files to be run from timesharing DDT.

There are two binary file formats: SBLK and PDUMP.  MIDAS generates
SBLK; the usual way of generating PDUMP is to start with an SBLK file
then use DDT's :PDUMP command.  Programs that expect to be PDUMP
binaries often include code to PDUMP themselves by VALRETing a :PDUMP
command to DDT when started from a special entry point after executing
some any one-time initalization code that's easier to do during
initial execution than during assembly.

Both are documented in SYSDOS;BINFMT 101.

Serial number appears to be 4469.  I got it from John Wilson, moved it 1000
miles to home.  It looks too heavy to drag up the stairs so chances are really
good it'll stay in the (heated) garage.  We also got a TU45 and a spare formatter
for it.  (Question, can I just plug any Pertec Unformatted 1600/800 drive into
that and make it work, or only special Pertec devices?)

Current status of the machine is unknown - It's never been powered on.
We'll be cleaning it up, taking lots of pictures, and checking things out
before it gets powered on.  But that should be sometime soon.  In any case,
I'll have pictures posted before the week's out.

And now, I'm going to do a jig and generally behave like a child until the
high wears off :) More information to come.

Congratulations!!

Speaking from experience, they *can* be dragged up stairs, but you'll expend
a lot of time, energy and friends in the process.

However, if you really want to get one up the stairs, I can attest to the
fact that they *can* be disassembled with ordinary tools and a lot of 
patience, leaving you with the two heaviest objects being the card cage
and the empty rack, both of which are a fairly easy move for two people.
It's a great way to really get familiar with your new KS.

(In fact, for a while, I had a "desktop 20" on my desk: just the card cage
 and power supply from a KS10.  I always wished I could have figured out a
 way to put a SCSI hard drive on the thing -- then I would have had a nice
 ITS box in a semi-portable form.  MASSBUS to SCSI (or was it UNIBUS to
 SCSI, I forget now) controllers did exist, but they were somewhere up in
 the $4000 range; more than I was able to comfortably afford at the time.)

Just for the record:  this KS10 and TU45 belonged to Gordon Greene, I was
only storing them for him, until he finally decided that if he hadn't powered
them on in the nine years since we retrieved them from Texas, it was never
going to happen.

Glad to hear you guys made it back OK, that was a pretty long round trip to
make in 2.5 days!

I'd be interested in you can verify that.  My first KS is 4464, which I had

The number is printed on the top rear of the rack, I have a KS10-AA, the
serial number as printed is MRR4469.  This is also printed in several
places on stickers affixed to other places in the rack.

Right now, I've finished making sure there are no obvious mechanical
faults (I.E. making sure I didn't destroy it moving it), pulling all the
various boards out, making sure the chips on them are well seated, etc.
Then I might just try turning it on. (The top of the Mighty Mite is rather
scary looking and I'd rather not go poking a voltmeter in there unless I
have to, lest I bridge two terminals or something and destroy it.)

Will it be unhappy with my if I plug all these 120 AC plugs (I found 3 so
far, one for the fan at the base of the rack, one for the KS logic, and
one for the UNIBUS box) into a normal powerstrip instead of DEC's?
I don't have the proper plug for the end of the power controller, and this
is what I do for my PDP-11s anyway.

Does anyone have the jumper settings for the console board?  I'l like to
not have to try guessing what speed/stops/bits/etc. it's set to.

Oh, and I did neglect to mention that the machine was earmarked for Gordon
Greene, who graciously let me snag the machine out from underneath him.
You have my eternal thanks, I didn't mean to leave you out.

Actually, you can _just_ get away with plugging it into a 15 amp
circuit if you unscrew the L5-30P and replace it with a 5-15.  I used
to do that all the time...  I was told by one person that the L5-30
was for mechanical reasons, not for electrical (L5-20 is kind of
wimpy).

Shouldn't be a problem, but the 115V/30A twistlock outlets are available
from Home Depot and probably any other place too.  The HDs around here
changed suppliers a while ago, so their twistlocks went from about $12 to
about $20, still not too bad.

Well, Unibus to SCSI does exist, but the big question is "do they
support 18 bit transfers".

Speaking of which, what actually told the RH11 that it was an 18 bit
transfer? Piddling a specific register? I've got some UC12's around here
somewhere, it would be simple to test em if I knew which bit to flip.

If there exists a MASSBUS-SCSI convertor that handles 18 bit, I will buy
it at any price.

True, however I went with the 20 amp plug and wired the room with 4 20
amp circuits @110 volts and 1 30amp at 220 (for the tape truck). Looks
like I'll need another 220 for the second TU45 pretty soon.

Now onto the interesting thing: After a year of waiting, SETASI finally
contacted me about the RP08 drives they sell. Bad news is that they do
not support 18 bit transfers...

However they DO have a device that basically emulates 8 RS04's using
memory. The interesting thought is that it does this by plugging
directly into the RH11, in place of the three M5903 interface boards. 

Now 8mb of storage isn't very interesting, but say 512mb of storage
(what, one DIMM?) would be *quite* interesting. Anyone got a manual
describing in detal how the RH11 works? This might be the trick to get
around the hellish MASSBUS timing issues. Just replace the whole MASSBUS
with a small CPU and a big pot of memory...

It has been done. And I for one would be quite happy to replace my disk
farm of 2 RM03's and 2 RM80's with a single Macintosh DIMM chip.

Even if they did, you'd have to find a SCSI disk that was 18 bits wide.
I have a Unibus SCSI controller, but to use it on the 2020 I would have to
write an MSCP driver for every OS I'd run, and also have the driver pack
and unpack the words (18 > 16 bits and vice versa).  The performance would
be insanely slow.

I have no idea, myself.  You'd have to look it up.

Heh, wishful thinking. :P


Anyway, I'm only short one board of one of the Massbus controllers, so I'm
going to flip a quarter and see if I'm going to power up the 2020 anyway
and see what I get.  Everything else looks sound, and who knows, I might
get something interesting...

On a sidenote, the TU45 I have says it wants 120 VAC, not 220.  Is this
wrong or should I trust the writing?  Even the DEC power controller at the
bottom of the rack says 120.  Conversly, if the writing is lying and I use
120 instead of 220, what do I toast?

I do know what'll happen if I use 220 and it wants 120, though... *POOF!*

Ah.  You do indeed have KS #4469, but I had a brain fade when comparing it.  I
have KS #4664.

Yes, and you only need to provide power for the fan and the KS backplane if
you don't need the tape drive or terminals (the CTY and KLINIK are off of the
KS backplane).  You do have to fix a bug in TOPS-20 to keep it from crashing
if no DZs respond.

You have to rewire jumpers on the RH11.  Cut some, add others.

You were right - It didn't like me.  I just went downstairs, plugged my
VT100 into the CTY port (I set it for 9600 N81 as just a guess), plugged
the KS backpanel and it's fan into a 20 amp powerstrip, bridged pins 1 and
3 on the UNIBUS box's DEC power controller plug (to let you turn the box
on without the controller at the bottom of the rack - I had to do this
trick for awhile to turn on the second BA11 in my 11/44), plugged the
UNIBUS in, and let 'er rip.

The Mighty-Mite whines at me (but it's not as loud as my 34A whines, it's
just there), some LED's above the KS boards light, the POWER light comes
on, a light comes on in the bottom of the UNIBUS box, the fans all come
on, and the machine just sits there.  I checked the serial cable, it's
good, and I noticed that if I unplug the Vt100 from the CTY port and push
BOOT, the FAULT light comes on.  I can clear the light by pushing RESET.
The power switch on the frontpanel doesn't do anything, and, if the BOOT
or RESET switches are pressed while the CTY is connected, they don't do
anything.  So obviously it wants either the missing RH11 board (I think I
have a spare, I'll check tomorrow) or something inside the power
controller.

Since I can leave the BA11 off, I'm going to unplug it and pull the board
from it's RH11 and shove it in the KS backpanel, and we'll see what
happens.

Took the missing RH11 board from the UBA, added it in the KS backplane,
and unplugged the UBA.  Booted the KS, and I have a KS10> prompt.
It wanted 1200 baud N81, if that helps anyone.

Now, to see if I have the missing board, get the normal DEC power
controller working, and put the skins on the machine so it looks nicer. :P
I took pictures of things, as soon as I get to work tomorrow I'll post
'em.

One last question, and them I'm done for tonight.
The Mighty-Mite's whining apparently is an alarm or something - because
it will shut itself off after more or less 5 minutes.  There are
temperature sensors above the cardcage - I've heard you get this sort of
misbehaviour if these go bad and continuously tell the PSU that it is over
temperature.  How can I test for and or eliminate this?  The CPU boards
aren't getting hot at all.  (Not even warm - in fact, the blower air is
kinda cold.)

You can set dip switches on the console board to change that.

I've never experienced this, and it doesn't use any external overtemp sensors.

It costs several hundred bucks to get one of those Mighty-Mites repaired; it's
a lot cheaper to get a replacement from salvage.  If you open one of them up,
you'll see why; unlike DEC power supplies a Mighty-Mite is a nightmare to
repair.

The Emulex MSCP-faking controllers I've seen have been quite smart,
dealing with geometry conversions and so forth themselves; I would think
that *if* they dealt with 18-bit transfers at all that they'd do the
right thing with regard to bit-packing.

I have an Emulex SCSI controller, a UC18 I think, without however any
documentation whatsoever.  This is especially irritating because I have
several dumpster-loads of docs, print sets, hardware, fiche, ad nauseam,
dating from when Columbia ditched their 2065's--*scads* of documentation
of DEC's stuff, but not a word about anything third-party.  (Chris, I'm
sure I have or had RH11 documentation if you can't find any closer to
home, but I thought I'd already lent it to you.  Maybe that was something
else, or maybe I pulled it from the library (which is mostly boxed,
although it's all out of the NJ warehouse now) and never did give it to you.)
If anyone would like to try something interesting with the UC18, or knows
anything about it (such as "you're wasting your time trying to get this
working with a 36 bit machine"), please let me know.

The TU45 uses power for several things:

The TM03 formatter: 240 volts (at least mine is, you can get TM03's at 120)
The Pertec power supply for the tape drive
And the big-ass blower motor.

The blower motor requires 220. Others can be retrofitted, however there is a
white plastic bus interface on the back of the TU45. All the ones I have
seen are 220 only.

Oh, good.  I'm going home with AC plugs tonight, so I can rewire the plugs
for standard outlets and try it on 120.  (Worst that'll happen is it won't
come on due to lack of voltage, right?)  But if it does want 120 and I
give it 220, things go boom, which is bad. :P

I'm not sure...  I can look, if you tell me what I'm looking for.

No disks.  I'm officially in the market for a single-phase Massbus
harddisk - 3 phase power isn't even an option around here, the power
company refuses to sell it to you. (I asked.)

If/when I do get a harddisk, this machine is getting ITS put on it.
Then all I have to do is get some sort of internet connection in the
house, and a small Portmaster or something to let people telnet to a DZ11
port... :P

Hm. Regarding that bug, does T20 blow up immediately when it doesn't find
the DZ11's?

This might explain why I can't boot the system with the second UBA shut
down. I'll check it out tonight. Running the T20 diags is a bit boring :-)

The TU45 might be a 120 volt unit. Does it have a TM03 or TM02 BTW?

Heh, none, I suspect, unless someone hacks Linux to do it.  Linux is being

Yes.  But I forget the details of the bug, and a quick look through my sources

The TU45 is 120 volt, and it came with either a TM03 (newer) or TM02 (older).

My memory on this is admittedly very hazy, and could very easily be wrong, but
my recollection is that after NCP on the ARPAnet was turned off, MLDEV
continued to use the ARPANet, not the CHAOSnet - which must have meant that
MLDEV was tweaked to use TCP. Can anyone confirm this?

If so, then the problem reduces to writing a driver for something other than
an IMP interface (probably an Ethernet interface), and getting the TCP code to
talk to that. (The side-benefit of this would be that getting general IP
access to the machine would probably be somewhat more useful than CHAOSnet, I
would venture...)

Or am I completely wrong, and the KA's were retired before NCP was? I don't
think they could have been, because otherwise KLH wouldn't have been enlisted
to write TCP for ITS.

    > And where did I put that IMP-11 interface... :-)

I'm trying to remember if the 2020 versions of MC, AI etc were ever connected
to the ARPANet, or not. If so, it would have had to have been via some variety
of IMP-11, so there'd be a driver. But I have this vague memory that they were
not on the ARPANet. I seem to recall there was talk of doing an Ethernet card
driver (since they had TCP), but it never happened.

I'm drawing a blank on this one.  Someone would have to tell me what MLDEV
is.

In the ITS copies I have, there's a driver for the Interlan NI1010A
UNIBUS ethernet card.  I don't know if it ever worked or not, and I don't
have any UNIBUS ethernet cards anyway.  I was going to get a Livingston
Portmaster or something similar and arrange it so if you telnetted to it,
you got a serial connection to one of the DZ11 ports.

Like I said, my copy has NI1010A stuff, but I dunno if it worked.

A pleasantly crazed individual named Brad Parker ported the original 
unix chaos code to linux. Won't get you "..in IP" without a little 
work, but will get you basic services and perhaps a mail gateway. I 
think he has it available on his website.

They were (I wrote the driver).

The IP/TCP driver for the Unibus ethernet cards was never finished, 
unless I have spaced completely. The chaosnet one might have been, 
think not tho. But most of the MIT KS's ran with chaos hardware until 
they were turned off.

I wrote about half of a DEUNA/DELUA driver for ITS seven years ago when I
had a KS10 running briefly, I'd love to finish it some day.

>I'm trying to remember if the 2020 versions of MC, AI etc were ever connected

Yes.  IIRC they were 10.1.0.6 and 10.2.0.6.

>I seem to recall there was talk of doing an Ethernet card

There's a partial NI1010A driver kicking around, but those boards seem to
be about as rare as 2020s these days.  Too bad, they're much easier to
program than the DELUA.

Forsooth! MLDEV was the pseudo-device (it operated by starting a process, to
which was passed the rest of the file-name) that was used to implement the
shared ITS filesystem.

IIRC, there was some magic directory where, when you gave the system a
filename with a device it didn't recognized (i.e. not one of the hardwired
ones), it looked in that directory for a file with that name and started it
(in a process?) to "implement" the device.

Wow! What flavor of IMP-11 interface did they use? A DEC one, or one from
someone like ACC?

If it was a DEC one, it surely wasn't the IMP-11A (which was a whole pull out
drawer of Flip Chips); do I recall DEC doing an IMP-11B which had an
indentical programming interface, but was like just one card?

That's my memory too. I'm pretty sure the only working LAN hardware in the
machines was the CHAOSnet (the hardware network, as opposed to CHAOSnet the
protocol) card.

Right. I have the Interlan (Micom Interlan) Unibus card over here on AI.
Also have the really homebrew chaosnet card.

I wonder if AI was connected to Ethernet, and used the Chaos card to format
packets?

Dan, on what do you have ITS source? Can you FTP me a copy so I can try
burning a few tapes (I've got an HP hooked to my Indigo, if I know the
format I can write a bit-fiddler)

Network file system driver -- nothing to do with NFS though.  It's what let

Easy to do with a junk 80x86 Linux box too, but it would be much cooler to
bring ITS's own TCP/IP up to date and use that.

I started a port of MLDEV to Chaosnet under Dave Moon's direction when I was
19, but I got all confused in LDB bitswapping and just wound up writing a
chaos FTP.  Chris Stacy succeeded, though, in moving MLDEV to Chaos.  I have
no recollection of TCP work, but if someone did it it was likely Ken
Harrenstein.  KLH moved ITS to TCP/IP long before the final switchover
deadline.

IIRC, there was a ribbon cable that plugged onto some of the pins on the edge
of the card, which connected to a modem (a small aluminium box, about 1" thick
by about 3"x4") which was wired inline, with heavy-duty coax connectors, to
the heavy CATV cable that CHAOSNet hardware used.

(I don't think anyone ever got CHAOS hardware running over thin cable; in the
latter days, people used CHAOS protocols over Ethernet hardware.)

I've got a utility that can read/write DUMP tapes with the TM03 fiddling:

	ftp://ftp.dbit.com/pub/pdp10/its/itstar/

It's written for Linux but it should be easy to get it going on any other
Weenix, probably just a few magtape ioctl() calls to fix up.  And it knows
about rmt so maybe you could run it on a Linux box anyway and use the Indigo's
tape drive?  Files on the Weenix side are in the 8-bit evacuated format.

Without looking at the driver I wrote for it to check, I'm pretty sure the
following is correct:

The CHAOS card had no function at all other than to send and receive packets
from the CHAOSnet. (Oh, it did the CHAOS hardware checksum - but that was
stripped off before it got to the CHAOS protocol processing.)

The ITS level of this mechanism was called the JOB/BOJ/OJB device.
If a user program opens the XXX: device, ITS would look in internal
tables to see whether it was something built-in (like TTY: or DSK:).
If it wasn't there, it would look for the file DSK:iforget;JOBDEV XXX
and run that.  User system calls to XXX: would turn into calls to the
JOB: device, which in turn would forward them to the JOBDEV handler
program (which was a more-or-less ordinary user program).  The JOBDEV
handler would open the BOJ: device (JOB spelled backward) to get the
processed calls from the user side.  The OJB: device was used to debug
a JOBDEV program; I don't know much about it.

JOBDEV MLDEV (the "ML" device) was the particular JOBDEV that took
ordinary file commands and remoted them over the network to other
machines.  Originally written so the AI machine could talk to the
ML machine, it was of course general and would be used between any
two ITSen.  Some people played games and refered to the MLDMMC:
device from AI, so every disk access involved all 4 machines.

There was a server half, called MLSRV, that was invoked as a network
server in the same way as the FTP server.  (Another "magic" directory
full of files that got invoked when the appropriate port was tickled.)

The other "famous" JOBDEV was CRTSTY.  ITS itself had a deep
understanding of 6 or so kinds of terminals, like VT100s and TTY35s.
To support the other 500, a few folks wrote a JOBDEV that would
interpret internal ITS TTY codes into whatever hairy escape sequences
were required by a given terminal.

Gotta keep those old brain cells firing, lest they waste away...

Forsooth! MLDEV was the pseudo-device (it operated by starting a process, to
which was passed the rest of the file-name) that was used to implement the
shared ITS filesystem.

IIRC, there was some magic directory where, when you gave the system a
filename with a device it didn't recognized (i.e. not one of the hardwired
ones), it looked in that directory for a file with that name and started it
(in a process?) to "implement" the device.

You're all scaring me :-) I thought I had a 'problem' wanting to boot
RSTS on a old pdp-11 with rk05's.  A KS10?  now *that's* retro :-)

how can I help?! :-)

The chaos code on my web site is a little old, linux kernel wise.
I've recently moved it to a 2.2.14 kernel (someone in california with
a similar lispm, er, 'problem' ask me to update it).

That port is not tested yet but I'll do it soon...

The port is a linux kernel module which runs chaos over ethernet.  It
presents an fd level interface to userland programs, in the same way
the original bsd patches did.  I compiled some/most (not all) of the
user apps and tested them to some degree.  As I recall the NFILE and
TAPE servers work fine, mostly because that's what I needed to get my
3600 going.  I never tried mail or terminal services, I think there
were just too much termio/termio/sgtty ugliness in the code for me to
handle at the time.  (i.e. but it was a port problem, not a kernel
protocol problem which stopped me, so someone suitably motivated...).

I tested it with my 3600 and XL1200 & Genera.  It's not fast but it
worked.  The old code is on http://www.parker.boston.ma.us

If you can find me an old pdp-11/45 with rk05's and a dectape I'll
hack the code to encapsulate inside ip for a point to point interface
:-)  (i.e. will work for retro hardware)  Or, alternately I could use
another symbolics monitor/keyboard :-)

-brad

ps: doesn't a KS10 need 220VAC and some serious air conditioning?
But then again, I think I have 220 in my garage and I certainly
have the space.  humm... :-)

Too many messages on this thread to be worth individal replies, so, in
no particular order:

MLDEV ran over Chaosnet in the latter days.  It was implemented as a
JOB device, ie, the client program binary was DEVICE;ATSIGN MLDEV, and
it was generally invoked via links with names like DEVICE;JOBDEV MC.
The server was DEVICE;ATSIGN MLSLV, generally invoked via a link named
DEVICE;CHAOS MLDEV.  In theory one could also invoke MLSLV via a link
from DEVICE;TCP SYN123, but no such link appears in the NX filesystem,
so I don't know if that ever worked.

There was also GZ's RMTDEV, which she wrote to let ITS users get at
files on OZ and XX.  It was a variant on the MLDEV protocol, most of
the changes had to do with an encoding scheme for non-ITS filenames
using SOPEN.  ITS had both clients and servers, Twenex just had
servers; there may also have been implementations for VMS and BSD, but
I don't really remember anymore.

MC-the-KS and AI-the-KS were attached to the ARPANET via ACC
interfaces at addresses 10.3.0.44 and 10.2.0.6 respectively.

JTW already answered the questions about the Ethernet card and driver.
My recollection is that JTW had the driver sorta kinda working but
stopped work on it after we determined that the TCP code would need
serious work to bring it up to date with respect to congestion control
algorithms, etc.  As I recall JTW putting it at the time, the only
thing that kept the ARPANET version of the ITS TCP code from being an
incredibly bad network citizen was that there was a limit to how much
trouble it could get into at BBN-1822 link speeds.

Chaosnet on the KS-10s was via Unibus chaosnet hardware, with ribbon
cables, external tranceivers, and coax that looked like garden hose.
I think the tranceivers may have been vampire taps, but I don't really
recall anymore.  The 9th floor KS-10s were on subnet 6, and were the
last machines connected to that subnet other than a MINITS box or two.

Provided you have either a multiport serial card in the PC, or Ethernet
hardware in the KS, neither of which I have. :P

I have it on a CDROM, but I can make that FTPable if someone needs it and
nobody objects.  It compresses to a 180 meg tgz file.

The binary files are saved in some odd format designed to make the text
readable on 8-bit machines, and I don't know it's format (but I'd like
it!)

I do have a couple 11/34As, neither of which have anything other than CPUs

No, mine likes 120AC, and we have air conditioning (or I could just open
the garage door - Illinois winters are cold enough to run a KL in your
house!)

Nope; the whole thing used the appropriate (about 3/4" diameter) coax
connectors. IIRC, the transceivers had ordinary coax connectors on them, and
you screwed them into a coax "T" connector, into which you then screwed the
coax connectors on the two CATV cables (or one CATV cable, and one terminator,
as the case might be).

My guess is that this was because the UNIBus CHAOS boards were all programmed
I/O (via a register which looked into an onboard packet buffer - my old driver
says:

  4$:	MOV @R4,(R2)+
	$LOOP R3, 4$

to read the packet out :-), and thus simpler to code; nobody had the energy to
get the more complex DMA Ethernet card going.

IIRC, VT100s *weren't* on the list of terminal types that ITS knew about
deep down inside (although it did know AAAs, which were ANSIish too but
with a different set of private doodads), which is part of why CRTSTY was

My recollection is that MC came with a pile of 'em, and ITS was
made to know about the basic 24x80 mode.  CRTSTY gave you better
redisplay over slow lines (remember 300 and 1200 baud modems?),
and worked with 132-column mode (if you paid extra for the
additional 1300 bytes of memory).

Wow, AAAs!  Ann Arbor Ambassadors!  Now that's a brain cell
that hasn't fired in a good long time...

You're both right.  The original original Chaosnet used vampire taps.
They were such losers (wiggle one and you shorted the whole cable)
that they were punted and replaced with the type N coax connectors
Noel remembers.

Yes.  (AI was 10.2.0.6.)  Though they were still available via CHAOSnet
for a fair while after net 10 went away.  (There was a *lot* of account
abuse on ether/CHAOS hosts right about then, oddly enough...)

It seems like everyone once started writing some ITS ethernet code but
didn't really finish.  Note that you may want to clean up the IP code, too.

There was a reason I can't remember that some people hated NI1010's with
a religious fervor.  Does anyone else remember this?  I remember the last
time I was thinking about ethernet implementations on the KSen that were
living at FTP at the time, *someone* was roundly flaming me for thinking
about doing on the NI1010 as opposed to a DEUNA or whatever...

I don't recall any VT100s in the early days of MC, but there were a bunch of
VT52s, which were a big win over Datapoints (a.k.a. VT05).  I don't think that
even CRTSTY supported the VT100 until the 1980s.

I'm surprised to hear that CRTSTY used the JOB device; I always thought (given
the name) that it used pseudo-terminals (which ITS called STYs).

You're right about the VT52's.

CRTSTY certainly used STYs, and now I'm trying to remember why
I thought it used JOBDEV too.  Maybe I'm just spazzing because
the big complaint was always that they took up a job slot in
the (finite) job table, and after a few dozen turists logged in
using CRTSTYs real users couldn't run their programs.

I'm pretty sure the ethernet driver never worked.  I remember
asking you in 1988 when you were going to
finish it because Chaosnet was going away.  This was
also when Alan Bawden and I were starting to write
C programs for ITS.  I forgot the reason why we were
trying to do this; it was either to port a UNIX TCP stack
to ITS and/or because Bawden had run out of ways to
avoid his thesis...

After the AAA's, I seem to remember adding an ANSI tty-type to ITS at Steve
Berlin's urging, because he wanted to handle BBN Bitgraphs, which could do
ANSI.

All these smarter terminals like the Heath/Zenith H19 and the AAA were a
pain in the butt because they required much more padding than a VT52 or a
glass tty or they'd drop characters, and we did not do brain-damaged ^S ^Q
flow control.

I do occasionally remember how, the morning after I pulled an all-nighter
putting the AAA code into ITS, I decided it would be safe to leave MC
running NITS, because I was the only person who had the newly-assembled
:TTYTYP (I think that's what it was called), so no one else could use the
AAA code, which still had some little bug in it.  And in fact I figured out
what that bug was, so I thought I'd just patch it before going off to bed,
although there were other people logged on; after all, none of them could
set their terminal type to AAA, so I was free to experiment.  I didn't even
have to put my patch into VPATCH before inserting the JRST in the right
place.  So $$^R, find the right place in the running kernel, insert JRST
VPATCH... BLAMMO!  Machine crashes; 15 lusers blown away.  In my
sleep-deprived state, I'd forgotten that _I_ was using an AAA... these were
the moments when you would go up to the system console and nod sagely at the
lusers and say judiciously, "Yup, we've been having trouble with that AMPEX
moby again..."

I have a a couple of PC multi-port serial port boards lying around.  One 
PCI, and the other ISA. I think they're both digiboard. The PCI one (and 
maybe the ISA) is probably supported by Intel GNU/Linux.  You're welcome 
to them.

I also recall building quite a number of PDP-11/MINITS based "Terminal 
Concentrators" for the 8th and 9th floors.  Half the fun was ordering the 
parts.  DCP would supply the code for the rack of EPROMs they booted 
from.  I remember wire-wrapping addresses on them, and the fun of running 
wires down the phone closet pipes.  

They were actually rather fun to build.  They had 16 ports or more of 
Serial/Chaosnet connectivity  which made your Concept 108/Ann Arbor 
Ambassador fly.  Of course, since ports did go bad, some people preferred 
a hardwired OZ/XX port.  And for the really hotsters you'd put a 
switchbox on your dumb terminal and switch back and forth between the TC 
and host (or FE11).

And I do remember both vampire taps and type N connectors for Chaosnet, 
and the wall-mounted chaos boxes that only Fred D. seemed to be able to 
fix eventually. Ah the memories of old CHAOSNET. 

And PAO is right, the mind does forget (or ephemerally GCs) pain, or 
possibly more readily remembers pleasure, in some cases...

Ah, but the Datapoints were a GREAT improvement over the GE bag
biters, which had a screen of 13 lines of 26 characters each
(uppercase only, of course), and a model 35 teletype keyboard.

Well, I might take you up on that, I have to use a Linux PC for the
console anyway. (VT100 can't upload microcode to the KS...)  But I want to
get the Mighty-Mite trouble resolved and get a harddisk before I try.
It'd be a waste of hardware if you shipped something out here and the
machine didn't work.

I'd looked kinda quick at the MINITS source, but never did much with it.
Did it run the Knight TV's too?

I won't dispute that.  I spent nearly seven long years of my life having to
use model 35s as my primary means of accessing a computer.  How I hated those
things.

Project Mac, with Datapoints and TVs (not to mention being able to run
programs of more than 20K), was like the Holy Land.  An unimaginable place.

I don't think so.  MINITs was some time after.  At the time I worked at 
the AI Lab (early 80's) the TV system was failing, and RMS showed me how 
to move around memory chips in the Knight TV frame buffer hardware to 
keep it usable.

I really liked the keyboards on those terminals.  They were noisy, and 
had the geometry a little like the IBM selectric keyboard (shiny rounded 
keys) and the spacing was nice.

Good luck with your KS.  It sounds like a good time.  They make nice 
holiday gifts I hear.

This was long enough ago that I'm not 100% certain of any of it, but I
think the TU77 was running through the end (it was the RP06s that were
dropping like flies), and I'm pretty sure that the last ITS tape drive
at MIT was a TU77.  The last TU45s I recall at Tech Square were the
ones that came off of XX when we finally liberated a TU78; if I recall
correctly, the TU45s stood pretty much idle after that, except perhaps
for a brief stint on BLT (the fifth MIT KS-10, which ran Twenex).  I
no longer remember whether we managed to convince Sean and Rich that
the TU45s were part of XX when they came to haul it away.

Alan, Cent, Ty, or JTW might remember more.

Right, except that Datapoint and VT05 are not at all the same thing.  I 
used them both quite a lot.  The Datapoint was much worse (and much 
older).   For one thing the Datapoint was green and the VT05 was white.  
They were both upper case only, maybe that's why your memory combined 
them.

I agree with TK that the GE Bagbiters (which I only used once) were by 
far the worst of all.  The display was an actual consumer TV set, black 
and white of course.  I believe the whole suite of terminals shared a 
single 1800 baud line to the computer.

It used a STY and didn't use JOB or USR.

Ok, it's fall, it's cool, and I can finally start working on AI again.
With the cold weather, I can pop open a window instead of fighting a
losing battle with an 8,000 BTU AC unit.

Quick bit of status: Sitting in my computer room here at the house is:

AI (20/20 system, fully loaded with memory, passes all diags)
RM03 (Fully operational, need to dust off and purge)
RM80 (Operational, however currently unformatted)
RM03 (Logic problem in getting the heads to load)
TU77 (Doesn't work, why?)
TU77 (Spare for parts)

I've got a pair of RM02's, a TU45, and an RP07 sitting in storage. The
TU45 is a bit of a shambles, maybe with Dan's system as a plate I can
diagnose it someday. The RM02's will work on a 20, bit slower than an
RM03, but same format. The RP07 is in God knows what kind of shape (the
lid for it disintegrated on Interstate 40...). A dream would be to get
that drive operational and running as the system disk.

Once running, the systems will move to a place where power and AC is not
an issue. Till then, they run at my house.

The big problem with AI is that the tape MASSBUS is dead. I don't have a
clue as to why. Diagnostics are very vague, closest thing I get on the
controller is a control bus parity error/8915 bit fiddler error.
According to the limited TOPS20 diags, this could be anything.

So in order to figure this out, I've spent the evening pulling out the
DZ11's, the chaos controller and the Micon Ethernet card. In it's place
I have installed a pdp11/23+ for running pdp11 diagnostics on the RH11.

Yes, I know: 11/23's are Q-Bus and the RH11 is a Unibus tank. However
I've also got a Qunivertor, and it seems to be working (albeit in 18 bit
mode). At least I can fire up RSX11/M and begin walkin through tests on
the TU77/TM03/RH11. And I don't have to deal with the main CPU, the 18
bit fiddler, etc... 

Thus my question: Did the tape drives work on AI before it went offline.
Somehow I seem to recall that they didn't, and this might be due to a
bad RH11 MASSBUS controller (as I have swapped in 2 other TM03
controllers with the same lack o results).

Well, this is my current showstopping problem...

The Mighty-Mite in my KS is acting funny.  I think it thinks it's over
temperature or something.  Last night, I redid the end of the rack power
controller so I could plug it into a standard outlet.  Connected up the
power-control cables, unplugged the UNIBUS because I can't use it (missing
a board), and turned everything on.  The red POWER switch on the panel 
turns the power on and off now.

Anyway, the problem is as follows.  When the Mighty-Mite is running, it
whistles at me.  It sounds almost like the same whining one of my 11/32As
makes because the power supply is underloaded, except that the MM whining
is a constant tone, kinda like an alarm or something, but not quite.
Anyway, it will run for more or less exactly 5 minutes, and then turn
itself off.  It doesn't feel warm, and the KS works just fine while it's
on - I've done bootcheck, told it to zero memory, and a few other commands
to make sure it can talk to me OK and it seems to do just fine.  Turning
the BA11 on doens't help, it just confuses the KS and I never get a KS10>
prompt.

There are two temperature sensors at the top of the KS cardcage, and I
suspect these are going bad and telling the Mighty-Mite that it's over
temperature.  I've heard of similar stuff happening to other machines.
But I was told the Mighty-Mite doesn't use these.

So, does anyone know if these sensors can kill the Mighty-Mite?  It's
possible that the Mite isn't doing the whining and it's coming from inside
the KS cardcage, but I swung the Mighty-Mite out and listened to it, and
it seems to be inside it's case.  Also, I have a single lead from the
stuff at the top of the KS cardcage that isn't connected to anything - it
ends in a white connector and just hangs there.  There's a sticker on it
but I can't read the sticker.  I don't know if this is related or not.

Anyway, I guess the base-level questions are, can the Mighty-Mite turn
itself off if it overheats or something, or can the KS logic do that?
Something is definetely turning it off on command though - You'd think
that if it was broken it wouldn't run at all, or wouldn't run the machine
at least.  As for the time, it's 5 minutes, to within a few seconds.  I
can time it with a clock.

The Decsystem20 power supply DOES (I repeat DOES) use the temp sensors up at
the top of the CPU rack.

I know this from reading the documentation on the KS10 (it's in there) and
because I overheated my computer room one night years ago (hint: a 8000BTU
AC will not keep up with an RM80, 2RM03's, 2TU77s and a 20).

The response for the 20 is to beep for a few minutes, then auto shut down to
save the CPU.

I think that is what your problem is.

Dan, I do have a spare power supply that I could loan to you if you try the
sensors and still have no dice.

Howabouts do you test those?  I have a VOM.  Can I just unplug them?  I
can see where they plug in at the back of the KS cardcage.

OK, I pulled them from the KS cardcage - There's not a lot of
identification on them.  There's two leads from each, a red and a white
one.  Writing on the back says "ELMWOOD SENSORS 3001".  The side reads
"3001-37-12 F105 78/51".

So, can someone with a printset please tell me what these are, and what
sort of replacement I should be ordering?  The only local electronics
supply place is a Radio Shack (Bleh!), so if they have it (or can order
it) that would be good.

I replaced the line cord ending on my TU45 last night so I could turn it
on.  It doesn't do a whole lot.  It makes an impressive amount of noise,
one of the fans needs a can of WD-40 really badly. :P I think it's messed
up though, I tried getting it to mount a tape and all it does is make a
mess unspooling the tape all over the place.  When you push LOAD, it runs
the take-up reel backwards slowly for a few seconds, then kicks both reels
forwards (with the tape now loose on the takeup reel) and stops,
unspooling the first 20 feet or so of tape around inside the drive. I
think it wants adjusting, and I was told you need 4 hands, a lot of
alcohol, and the ability to swear in 42 languages to successfully do this.
If anyone with manuals has any idea what to do about this and can tell me,
that would be good.

Of course, I might also be threading it the wrong way, but I tried both
ways with similar results.

I think I remember this discussion...  Was it ever determined if the KS
itself or the drive was at fault?

My question is, as the 2020's RH11 is modified to be special to the
2020, will it work right on a PDP-11?

Turns out Elmwood Sensors still exists.  I got them on the phone, sorry
for annoying everyone.

According to them, it's not a temperature-sensitive transistor or
a wind switch or anything like that - It's a simple temperature-operated
switch.  It's either on or off, and the trip temperature appears to be 105
degrees.  The guy I got wasn't sure. Since it's just a switch, and
it's open at the moment, that means the KS wants it closed.  I'll bug
ratshack to see if they have anything similar, but the Elmwood guy says it's
either on or off, so I can just short the leads and get the same effect.
(I just have to be careful about not burning up the machine!)

If I'm being a pain, someone let me know, and I'll stop...

All of the MIT KS ITS machines ran on RP06s, same as OZ and XX.

Correct. And the RP06 is one drive you do *not* want in your house. It
wants 3 phase. It's wider than your TU45. It weighs around 700lbs. It's
disc pack is huge (10 platters). And the MASSBUS interface is a very
seriously odd device.

The RP06 is also based on the RP05/RP04 which were enhancements of the
RP02/03 drives. So basically you're talking about a drive with the tech
from say 1972ish. If I recall, they doubled the tracks on the 02/03 to
make the RP04/05 and doubled the sectors to make the RP06.

Not to mention it's only got 176mb of space. 

So the thought is "What kind of disk to run on a 20"? SETASI drives
don't work in 18 bit mode, which leaves you with the DEC drives. 

RM03's are pretty plentiful and are quite modern in design. Problem is
they only store 67mb per pack. Tight if you're tying to replicate ITS.

RM05's are a good deal. I think they want 3 phase but they store 256mb
per pack. Much better. They are also based on the CDC design, and are
pretty modern.

RM80's are the caddilacs for this kind of job. Winchester discs, single
phase, don't really pull much more power than an RL02 and they store
120mb. They are also the fastest drives you can get on an RH11 based
MASSBUS.

RP07's are God in a box. And like God, they are fickle, require constant
worship, unlimited power, and will usually melt your pitiful Unibus
(even the 20's hog-mode Unibus) with their speed. However I have heard
of them being formatted to run on an 11/70, so they *might* work on the
2020's. If you have a 2060, these are the way to GO. 512mb per unit, and
a lot o' speed.

Come to think of it, I think the 2060's could use SC type disc systems
(StarCoupler which attached to the HSC50's). If you could get a 2060,
then you could run some modern DSA discs.

A common thought is "Well, how about putting a SMD disk (small) on a
RH11 MASSBUS adapter"? This is a good idea, but DEC screwed with some of
the SMD signals, and no one has been able to get it to work. Running say
an 2322 Fujitsu (176mb) on a MASSBUS controller is truly the holy grail
of these projects.

Devote your energies to this task, and you will go to ITS heaven. That
and the possible replacement of the 5903's with a 512Mb SIMM are the
best bets for storage long term. Even the RM80's will wear out.

The RH11 on the tape drive side is just a normal RH11. The one for the
discs is specially hacked to run in what's called "Hog mode DMA". This
is where it grabs the bus for transfers and never lets go.

On a pdp11, this would starve any other DMA device. On the 2020, the
RH11 is the only thing on that Unibus, and the 20's UBA is designed to
cache stuff coming in from the Unibus (in 18 bit chunks) and forward it
to the CPU/memory in 36bit chunks.

Oh, OK.  I thought the tape one was odd too.  I'm sorry.

Well, it didn't like a dead short there - if you do that (to either
sensor) it turns the power off and won't turn it back on.  So, I skipped
off to Radio Shack, and picked up a pair of megohm potentiometers to see
if it wants some in-between resistance.  It doesn't seem to - At about
3.8K ohms, it'll beep like it does when it's complaining about the
temperature, anything lower shuts the power off entirely.

Any ideas?

I finally got it through my head that it might be the mighty-mite that is
actually bad, which, not only is it the worst case (which should
automatically tell me that's what happened. :) it's harder to fix.  I
connected a VOM to both temperature sensors and tested them.  They work
flawlessly.  Off for cool, on for hot.  You can hear an audible click when
they switch.  So, the mighty-mite itself is damaged.  Remember, children,
optimism is a bad thing.  I'm surprised I got caught by this one because
my usual operating procedure is to assume the worst case scenario and work
up from that.

For right now, I'm going to leave it alone until I get the rest of the
machine situated.  I built a Linux machine to use as a KS console so I
could try loading the CRAM but it's serial port (PC built-into-motherboard
dealie) doesn't correctly generate 1200 baud (Surprise!) so that's also
screwed until I get another (older) serial port.  The TU45 is also
behaving badly, it wants aligned.  I suppose I can try figuring that out.
In the meantime, the RH11s are missing parts, the tape drive's busted, the
power supply's going wonky and I don't have a hard disk, but other than
that, I'm doing just fine. :P

Can anyone hunt out documentation for the CSL board and tell me how to set
the console baudrate?  It needs to be faster than 1200 anyway - I'm going
to be writing tapes and such from the console (eventually, I hope) and it
would suck to take all night to do that.

A DF10 has 18 bit word count and 18 bit address, so you can have 256K/word
of physical memory.

A DF10C has 14 bit word count and 22 bit addresses so you can have 4Mw of
physical memory.

You can rewire a DF10 to a DF10C pretty easy, if you find a wire_wrap tool for
the big pins in the 'backplane'.

Almost;

You need to move the boundry between word_count and address 4 bits,
but it's a 'copy-paste' operation.

I could scan the diagram pages that differs between df10 and df10c if
you have a real need for them.

After a nice, long day of dealing with idiots on the Internet, it has to
spring to mind; Has anyone given consideration to those of us with the
suitable equipment in out houses/garages/Y2K bunkers/bomb
shelters/etc. wiring oour stuff together and creating a new Internet where
only people with IQs greater than their shoe sizes can participate?

(You must be --->THIS tall to use the Internet! ^_^)

In any case, I got my Mighty Mite problems solved (Fan inside the MM
wasn't turning.  WD40d it, pushed it with my screwdriver, off it went) but
now the microcode is misbehaving.  Does anyone know if the console ROM
version and the microcode version are related somehow?  I.E. does a V5
console need newer microcode than a V4 console does?  Mine's acting
completely bizarre.  I have a V5 console and some unknown version of the
TOPS-20 microcode.  (Yes, I knowthere's different microcodes for ITS,
TOPS-10, and TOPS-20.)

(By they way - The first paragraph is just a rant.  You can mostly ignore
it.  Excuse my lack of spaces in places, this keyboard is dying.)

I don't think so.  What, precisely, is happening?  How are you loading the
microcode?

OK.  First off, I have no working peripherals, so I load the ucode over
the console.  I got a C program from Anders Magnessun (port maintainer fro
NetBSD-vax) that sends a CH command, and then a series of deposit cram
commands to load the ucode.  The input is from a text file that looks like
the output of a bunch of examine cram commands.

Sometimes during the loading, the console proccessor will lock up, and I
can't get it to answer me.  Sening a BREAK gets me a page or so of ?UI
and nothing else.  I have to push the RESET button on the machine to
remedy this.  When it does happen, garbage gets put in the CRAM location
that was bein deposited.  So, I hacked the program to resend the line it's
working on if it eve sees a question mark from the KS.  (Specifically, the
one brinted when the automatic boot fails.)  In any case, it sends the
microcode over the wire, and gets it poked in correctly on the KS's siide.

Once the microcode is loaded, all I can do to it is issue a CS command to
start the clock.  SM doesn't work (?DNC error) and neither does HA (Same
error).  I tried putting 254000 001000 at location 1000 and issuing a ST
1000, but that just hangs up.  ^\ will get me the console back.  SI tells
me the PC is always 000000,,000000.  I don't know enough about the ucode
to try anything else.  Oh, and whenever the clock is running, the STATE
lamp lights, but when I stop the clock, the lamp goes out.  I don't get
any error messages so the CRAM is apparently holding what gets put in it.

Hmm.  ?UI is an "unknown interrupt"; the console received an interrupt but
there's no character in the CTY or KLINIK.  What speed are you driving the CTY
input?

?DNC is "did not complete"; an SM or HA command didn't end up with the
microcode in its halt loop.

Did you try doing an MR followed by a ZM after powering up the machine?  I've
found that ZM cures a remarkable number of ills.  Be prepared to wait a while
for ZM to finish...

1200 baud - That's what it came set to, and I wanted to introduce as
little variables into the formula as I could.  I'll jack it up later after
everything works.

That makes sense.  So, the microcode is running but it never makes to to
the lhalt loop.  That would explain why it won't run instructions
right. :P

Oh yea; I forgot that part.  On initial power-up, I do MR, CH, BC, ZM to
bri ng the machine to a semi-sane state.  This never fails and always
passes.  The only time I manage to crash the CSL is loading microcode.  I
tried popping the CRAM boards out and reseating them, no dice.

OK, got the microcode to load, RUN, and the actually _EXECUTE INSTRUCTIONS_!

The microcode loader worked by sening a CH, a LC0000000, a DC command, and
them spamming DN commands until the CSL hung, or it reached the end of the
ucode file.  I thought maybe the pointer that makes DN work might get
clobbered when I pushed RESET, so I modified the program (again) to send
a LC command before spamming more DN commands on a CSL crash.  Then it
hung about 4 times as bad, but NEVER immediately after a LC command, or
the DC immediately following.  Hrm!  This is awful funny!  So I issued a
TR to see just what the ucode was doing.  Turns out whenever the CSL
crashes, it's ALWAYS after a DN command affecting ucode, and it will
randomly clobber some other word of the ucode when it does (Usually by
loading all 7s, but sometimes just munging the ucode word.)  So I changed
the program a 3rd time to send just LC/DC combinations and never use
DN.  And it worked!  No more CSL crashes, and SM/HA work, and I got it to
run simple programs!  I put this at 1000, ran it, and it worked!

1000	MOVEI 0,1
1001	MOVEM 0,42
1002 	ADDM 0,42
1003 	SKIPL 42
1004	JRST 4,420
1005	JRST 0,1002

It took awhile, but soon as 42 hit 400000,,000000 it halted with 420 in
the PC!

So now, all I need is another M7294-YA so I have one for each MASSBUS, (I
only have the tape one, and I had to put it in the disk RH11 to make the
machine work, so now the machine works OK but neither RH11 works. :P I
don't suppose I can hack a PDP11 M7294 and make a YA, can I?), find a
harddisk, and I'm an ITS installation, and connecting that to the Internet
is semi-trivial. :P It wouldn't be a 24-7 connection, the telco would rape
me raw with the line charge, but it's still be a net-connected PDP-10! ^_^

OK, this TU45 is giving me a lot of grief, I've tried tweaking every
variable resistor I can find and none of them makes the takeup reel spin
the correct direction (It's going backwards).  Can I take the Pertec drive
out of there and just put in any 1600/800 BPI Pertec Unformatted device,
or is this drive special?  Because I know I have at least one other pertec
unformatted drive in working condition... (But it's the tensioner arm
type, not a vaccum column type.)

The proposed tape drive released it's magic smoke (Crisped a capacitor on
the write control board) when powered on, and that was (for the most
part) the end of it.  I might have a spare but I think it's toasted too.
Oh well.

Is there any difference (other than jumpers/switches) between the disk
RH11 and the tape RH11?  I need to get one or the other to work. :P

Problem is, I need it as dumped by EC XXXX commands on the CTY.  I.E. as a
text file with lines like

000042/03710707500000020000377660634116

in it, where 42 is the c-ram location.

Conversely, if someone can explain how to demangle the listing in mcr.262
and get the same thing, that would work too.  Problem is, there's 12 extra
bits in the listing data, and I can't tell what bits are supposed to be
there and which aren't.

I don't remember the details.  This comment in mcr.262 gives some
hints about the format of ram.262, but only some analysis gives the
full truth:

; 487   ;WRITE A RAM FILE WITH THE FIELDS REARRANGED SO THE 8080 CAN HACK THEM
; 488   ;The RAM file format appears to be:
; 489   ;
; 490   ;4000 sequential CRAM locations starting at 0.
; 491   ;Each location is 96 bits expressed as 8 12-bit bytes and one
; 492   ;padding byte packed into three words.  Bytes are in right to
; 493   ;left order within 36-bit words, and also within the 96-bit
; 494   ;words.  Thus RAM SRC through MARK are in the right 12 bits of
; 495   ;the first 36-bit word and J is in the middle 12 bits of the
; 496   ;third 36-bit word.  Parity is even parity, computed separately
; 497   ;for the two halves of the word packaged on different boards.
; 498   ;
; 499   ;.RAMFILE takes the fields in left-to-right (pdp10) order,
; 500   ;thus the 8080's eight 12-bit bytes are given in order 2,1,0,5,4,3,pad,7,6
; 501   ;One parity bit is for 0-4, the other is for 5-7.

Please have a look at the microcode disassembler.  I'll try to help
you when you've done some research of your own.  After all, I'd love
to see an ITS machine up and running again! :)

I found out that what I want is PHYSICAL format ucode words, not listing
or ramfile format, so I'm hacking the disassembler to make it dump out the
physical-format words as well as disassemble.  I'll email you a copy of
the changed .c files when I finish and verify that it works.

For the curious and the spectators, physical format microwords are
documented in AI:KSHACK;REF 1.  The fields are all scattered around!

alas, no. the AIKA went to the concourse computer club folks (an MIT
student org.). we told them to tell us if they later decided they didn't
want it any more.  when peter lothberg came over here to pick up MC, his
shipping container had plenty of room left, so we checked to see whether
the CCC folks still had it/still wanted it/it still worked in any fashion.
we were horrified to discover that Gill Pratt had just sold it to a scrap
dealer for its materials, apparently to make room for some sort of
solar-car project he was then involved in, without any notice to us
whatsoever.

I confess that I am responsible for a similar fate happening to SAIL's KA10; I
sold it to a scrap dealer.

In my defense, that KA was thoroughly fried, and was sold to me with full
knowledge of its fate.  It had a fan failure but its overtemp sensor didn't
trip for some reason.  I don't know for sure, but other SAIL hardware met its
demise in the 1980s due to incompetant "repairs" by a certain individual who
will go nameless.  Not that all that many people remember him.

I salvaged the front panel, the meter panel, the adder boards, and the bay
screens (although one of them cracked when I moved to Washington State.  I
still have these, although some of the adder boards have been given out as
souvenirs to various visitors over the years.  I also salvaged the BBN pager;
the last I heard, Peter Lothberg & co. had it on a working KA10 in Sweden
running Tenex.

Everything else went to the scrap metal dealer, who paid me only half of what
I paid for it.

I also have the front panel from one of the IMSSS KI10s, a PDP-12 front panel,
and a PDP-15 front panel.

As I remember, ML's KA was in much better condition than AI's.  DM's was also
in pretty good shape.  What happened to those?

They were in the basement of 545 TS, in a random storage room that MIT
owned, for a while. I seem to recall that at some later point, when they
needed the space, they were taken out and moved somewhere else (not sure
whether it was off-site storage, or the scrap bin).

   They were in the basement of 545 TS, in a random storage room that MIT
   owned, for a while. I seem to recall that at some later point, when they
   needed the space, they were taken out and moved somewhere else (not sure
   whether it was off-site storage, or the scrap bin).

Too many years ago, I saw several racks of DM including the front
panel at the old MIT Surplus Property Depot out on the west end of
Albany Street.  I remember my amazement that it was there, and hadn't
been salvaged for a better fate.  Don't know what happened to DM after
that.

Wonder how accessible old records are at the MIT Property Office???
They might tell the tale.

If it got shipped off to the Mass Surplus Depot in Taunton, it might
still be there...

Hi everybody,

I'm looking for information about the display devices connected to the ITS
systems, especially the special-purpose hardware built by Knight and others.
In particular I'm wondering

	- what was the keyboard layout?

	- what was the resolution of the screen (in pixels and characters)?
	  Yes, I realize some hardware was vector-oriented.

	- what support for text attributes (bold, dim/intense, underline,
	  etc.), special characters (e.g., in the low 32 positions of
	  ASCII), or graphics?

	- how was keystroke/display information embedded in the byte stream
	  (or 9-bit word stream, or 12-bit word stream) going back and forth
	  and how easily did ITS work with it?  From poking around the files
	  on toad.xkl.edu I believe that TECO and ITS had a number of levels
	  of quoting.  That sounds very cumbersome to me but it could be
	  partly the fault of TECO rather than ITS.

	- what was the state of the art of displaying equations and other
	  fancy typesetting?  I'm thinking of the kind of equations MACSYMA
	  might produce, or the kind of typesetting necessary to print a
	  thesis (or *gasp* a typical UNIX man page).

	  With bitmapped, vector, or storage-tube displays you can do a nice
	  job (if slow).  More interestingly, it seems to me that you would
	  only have to add a few features to a typical ASCII terminal for a
	  vast improvement in quality -- half- or quarter-width (or height)
	  character positioning, half- or quarter-size characters, and the
	  ability to draw any part of a box around any character position. 
	  But I'm not aware of any work along those lines.  Even today, most
	  math output is either plain ASCII or fully-rendered "WYSIWYG".

	  Of course those features could be less simple to add than I
	  thought.

And if anyone has a similar source for information about Stanford, SAIL,
WAITS, and some of their other software (like the E editor) I'd appreciate
it.  Thanks!

I will attempt to answer some of your questions as best I can.

First I have to explain that ITS generally supported three kinds of 
terminals: off-the-shelf terminals, Imlac PDS-1 display computers, and 
Knight TVs.

The off-the-shelf terminals were what they were, we couldn't modify them 
(well, I modified one a little bit), and many different types were 
supported over the years.  Generally they either did not have any special 
features that worked, or the special features were not used because not 
all terminals supported them, so these generally just displayed the 95 
ASCII printing characters (sometimes only the 63 ASCII uppercase printing 
characters) in a 24x80 (sometimes different dimensions) array.

The Imlacs in the DM-CG group were vector graphics devices that were 
programmed to emulate ASCII terminals.  There were also some graphic 
applications, the ones that I saw were games.  The AI PDP-6 also had a 
DEC 340 vector graphics display which could be used as a somewhat 
illegible ASCII terminal emulator (as well as for graphics), with a 
Stanford keyboard.

The Knight TVs were shared-logic bit-mapped monochrome displays at NTSC 
resolution, with a single pdp-11 running all 14 displays.

Usually we were happy if a terminal just worked from one day to the next 
without smoke coming out and the screen going blank, and without the 
Intel 1103 SRAMs in the Knight TVs dying.  Adding fancy features was not 
really in the picture.

>In particular I'm wondering

Different on every type of terminal.  If you're asking specifically about 
the Knight keyboard, unlike SAIL MIT-AI did not deviate from the standard 
typewriter layout, except to add a few additional keys, the most notable 
being Call (to get the system's attention), Top (a shift key which 
survives as Alt on the IBM PC keyboard) to select alternative characters 
on top of the letter keys, and Meta (another shift key similar to 
control).

>	- what was the resolution of the screen (in pixels and characters)?
>	  Yes, I realize some hardware was vector-oriented.

Different on every type of terminal.  The Knight TVs were 576 wide by 454 
high by 1 bit deep.  That translates to 96 characters wide and 41 (?) 
lines tall.

>	- what support for text attributes (bold, dim/intense, underline,
>	  etc.), special characters (e.g., in the low 32 positions of
>	  ASCII), or graphics?

None (i.e. if you wanted your program to work on all terminals, you used 
the least common denominator of features).  The Knight TVs had a random 
selection of mathematical symbols and lower-case greek letters in the 33 
non-printing ASCII positions, and could be memory-mapped into pdp-10 
address space for bit-mapped graphics.  A few off-the-shelf terminals 
supported character attributes but I don't think these were used in any 
significant way.  If they had been, character attributes probably would 
have been implemented in the Knight TVs, and they weren't.

I suspect you are a bit confused by whatever you read.  Once you realize 
that keyboard input, display output, and text are three different data 
types that are only loosely related to each other, you see there is no 
problem.  Each has its own representation.  Only text is 7 bits per item.

I don't remember anything like this for output to glass.  Of course for 
output to paper there were a variety of typesetting programs.  I think 
Macsyma's output used only standard ASCII characters to portray formulas.

ITS documentation eschewed boldface.

Note that ITS long predated the idea of WYSIWYG editing.  Nobody expected 
the output to glass and the output to paper to look the same in those 
days.

The developers of ITS were not in a position to add features to standard 
ASCII terminals.  There were ASCII terminals available with additional 
kludges for drawing crude graphics out of character-sized pieces; you can 
also find such things in the original display for the IBM PC.  I don't 
recall anyone on ITS using those features but I might not have known 
about it.

I'm not sure there ever was any ecological space for something in between 
plain portable ASCII and fully rendered graphics.

Leonard Tower pointed out a silly mistake -- it's toad.xkl.com.  XKL makes
or made PDP-10 clones.  TOAD runs TOPS-20 with a decidedly Stanford-ish
flavor (not surprising since they used Stanford's backup tapes) though sadly
many references to interesting files are dead ends.

Let me get back to the list about their new-account policy (I want to save
them from dealing with a flood of requests).

There were some modifications done to plain ASCII terminals to benefit ITS,
or ITS programs ported to other systems.  Leonard Zubkoff, now at VA Linux,
developed special ROMS for the Heathkit H19/Zenith Z19 in 1980; admittedly
that was fairly late in ITS history and Moon was going/gone to Symbolics by
that time, so it may not interest either of you, but for the sake of history
I bring it up.  There was special Emacs support for this terminal type in
ITS and Twenex (TOPS-20) Emacs, written by Leonard, to take advantage of the
features.  The features were designed to save bandwidth over modems (such as
the blazing Racal/Vadic 1200 baud), and did not, as far as I know, offer
additional graphics capabilities.  (Interestingly enough, Leonard
copyrighted the implementation and was quite zealous about it, leading if I
recall correctly to conflicts with Stallman.  Now Leonard works for an open
source company...)

Additional features of the Knight TV system involving graphics and special
keys that may interest you (though I was in no way involved in implementing
them):

1. There was a bug button labeled CALL at the upper right.  This was also
sent to the PDP-11, and requested a free framebuffer be allocated to your
TV.  More often than not, though, it did nothing.  Usually the display
showed the contents of a "finger" buffer.  One buffer on the PDP-11 was
allocated to a finger display that was refreshed periodically.  It had the
results of calling finger@ai, and if there was room at the bottom there was
sometimes a graphic drawn.  I remember seeing a line-drawing of the StarShip
Enterprise, but there may have been others.  I presume the PDP-11 did the
finger and drew the graphic, but I am not in a position to know for sure;
perhaps this will jog someone's memory. I think the buffer went away when
you logged out of ITS, but you could change the login in ITS without logging
out to avoid giving up the buffer.  Occasionally people would leave for
lunch to find themselves logged out and their buffers gone.  (Computers were
faster at night in those days.)

2. There was a big button labeled ESCAPE at the upper left of the keyboard.
This was not the ASCII 33 key -- that was labelled called "ALT" and labelled
with a diamond, which is how it printed out on the Knight TV systems.
ESCAPE was a separate key that was sent to the PDP-11 front end.  There were
a few commands that the PDP-11 could process.  If you had your own frame
buffer already, typing ESCAPE F viwed the aforementioned finger buffer.  I
can't remember what letter you typed to get back, whether it was ESCAPE F
again or some other letter.  But you could also "spy" on someone else's
framebuffer if you typed ESCAPE followed by a digit and then that letter.
You couldn't control their input, but you could tell the video switch to
send you their output.  This helped in collaborative debugging; I remember
doing this with RMS and also having him send me unsolicited advice about my
TECO code in progress; I tried this myself with a research fellow and found
that she did not "cotton to" my proffered help.  Such was culture.  In those
days everybody read everybody else's mail anyway.   ESCAPE D buzzed the door
lock on the 9th floor, a big deal for those who did not have Medeco keys to
get in.  ESCAPE E called the elevator; I think Danny Hillis ran the wires
either the first or the second time, and it worked for both 8th and 9th
floor.  (Later Lisp machines emulated these two operations, and with the
expansion to 7th and 3rd floors of NE43 in Tech Square, it would pop up a
dialog saying "I don't know how to get an elevator to your location".
Someone (Daniel Weise?) made Escape P pop up a pizza dialog, but nobody ever
got the Votrax hooked up to order -- it just said "I don't know how to get a
pizza to your location.")

3. The 3rd floor Logo Lab had their own versions of the keyboard designed
for children.  The keyboard case and key action was the same (was it Hall
Effect?), but the keys themselves were different.  Some keys were missing,
and some were funny colors, and there were some extra keys.  There was a
Logo machine developed, using a PDP-11 running Logo (the 3500) and another
whole computer (a bitslice or 2600 plus random logic?) running a vector
graphics display engine for the display.  There was also a PDP-11
timesharing system called SITS, but as far as I know it had no display
system other than possibly working with the 2500's -- I'm out of pre-history
here.

4. There were features of ITS designed to support high quality output.  The
XGP (Xerox Graphics Printer) was in place by the time I arrived, and I
believe initial support for ITS was written by Marc Crispin.  The XGP used a
CRT to expose paper, and a variety of layout programs took text input and
produced output in the format used by the XGP.  There was a previwer
program, but given that the XGP produced something like 200 dpi and the
displays were about 500 pixels wide, you couldn't see much of the page.  I
remember one system called "pub" that encouraged lots of font changes.  We
used to joke that people who put each part of speech into a different font
caused "terminal font disease."

The developers of ITS were not in a position to add features to standard

kludges for drawing crude graphics out of character-sized pieces; you can 
also find such things in the original display for the IBM PC.  I don't

I'm not sure there ever was any ecological space for something in between

I believe that CALL also was the "stop job" key, replacing CTRL/Z on TVs.
This was also what CALL did on WAITS at SAIL, except that CALL was trappable
on ITS but was not on SAIL (thus it was impossible to write a noninterruptable
program for WAITS).

The program to do font compilation, rendering, and printing on the XGP was
already in place when I arrived.  However, the only way that you chould print
something was link to the mod 35 TTY that had the XGP and give a command to
it.

I wrote the XGP spooler; instead of waiting for the XGP to be free, you just
queued the file to the spooler and waiting for it to print.  To the dismay of
many in the ITS community, it prioritized requests, first by file size and
then by giving AI members (as recorded in INQUIR) a priority boost over others
(LCS, tourists,...).  Rumors to the contrary notwithstanding, I was following
orders from AI management; it was not my decision.  It was about that time
that RMS decided to create his elitist "$" INQUIR classification to indicate
his independence from AI (but "$" also got a priority boost).

It had a few options, including the THESIS option to block printing of the
request until someone gave a command on the XGP mod 35 to indicate that thesis
quality paper was installed in the XGP (at which point requests which didn't
have the THESIS option were blocked until another command was given to say
that ordinary paper was back.

I also wrote a job device called XGP so you could see the status of the queue
and XGP hardware with XGP CTRL/F.

No, the free-TV screen was drawn by a "daemon" (not ITS terminology) 
program running on the pdp-10.  Shockingly I can no longer remember its 
name after 20 years or so.  All the pdp-11 did was program the video 
switch to route the video from the free-TV screen buffer to all the TVs 
that were not currently connected to their own video buffer.

One reason for this, besides just giving the free TVs something to look 
at, was to show a list of the users on all logged-in TVs with their idle 
time, so you could figure out whose video buffer to steal when all 13 
possible login video buffers were currently in use.  If someone was idle 
5 hours and not running anything useful, and they weren't equipped with 
too high a level of either prestige or surliness, one might go to a TTY 
terminal, gun them down, and then quickly hit CALL on your TV to take 
their slot.

Such was the era before personal computers.

    I don't remember anything like this for output to glass.  Of course for 
    output to paper there were a variety of typesetting programs.  I think 
    Macsyma's output used only standard ASCII characters to portray formulas.

I have a vague memory of being startled by Macsyma using H19 graphics
characters (probably in its Tektronix emulation set) to show parts of
an integral sign.  I don't think it used anything else from that set,
and I don't think it did this on most other terminals, so it was kinda
gratuitous, but still slightly prettier than drawing an integral with
straight ASCII.

A friend is looking for pointers to Lisp implementations of the Domain
Name System (DNS).  Please send any info to me (unless you think the
whole its-lovers list would be amused, of course), and I'll forward
whatever I get to him.

Apologies for the somewhat off-topic query, but this group seems more
likely to be able to answer the question than the more usual venues
for discussion of DNS implementations.

I've read the TERMS.INFO and ITSTTY.INFO files, so I have a good idea about
features.  They are dated 1985, but that could be different from their
actual creation dates (because of backups or whatever).

TERMS actually implies that a fair amount of modification went on, either
with or without manufacturer support.  Mostly it was to get terminals to
behave more like the ITS "reference" terminal, not to add fancy features.

Yes, the KTV is the one I was wondering about.  I understand the basic idea
of the extended character sets (how Control and Meta affect ASCII and how
the modifier bits affect 9- or 12-bit characters), it's just the details I'm
trying to nail down.

There was also a BACK/NEXT key, I gather, and an ESCAPE key (different from
ALT MODE).

I assume Top produced only the 33 extra characters you mentioned later?

Did the KTV put out 8-, 9-, or 12-bit characters?  If 8, then Top would be
equivalent to Control (though the Top version of a letter could be
associated with that letter, even if it was a Control version of a different
character).  Did the two-key equivalents of special characters (Control-Z
and Control-_) quote their bytes with ^_?

What I would really like is a chronology of the various hardware.  I know it
went back and forth between MIT and Stanford.  And no one's mentioned the
Grinnel keyboard yet.

That would give you a character size of 6x11 dots with 3 rows left over.

It turns out my TECO confusion is mostly independent of my terminal-handling
confusion.  I have read through ITSTTY.INFO again and it makes more sense. 
I thought the set of input characters included Super and Hyper, though, but
it seems not to.

Obviously the resolution was much less.  I was simply thinking that you
could have acceptable presentation for a reasonable cost (in added
hardware).  I could be wrong though.

As I said, I could be wrong. :)

I've noticed that the MIT and SAIL communities were not open-source utopias. 
Of course they did have lots of open source, but there were some
restrictions like the ones you describe (e.g., on MACSYMA).

I've seen a description of pub in a paper about typesetting software -- very
interesting!  It also contained a description by Knuth of generalized
hyphenation points ("kerfs").  I bring this up because they were slightly
more general than what actually appeared in TeX!

As I said to Moon, a chronology of hardware/software -- or a few pictures --
would be immensely helpful.

There was also a special Tektronix output device, that would reproduce the
screen from a Knight display on special paper.  One of the ESCAPE-x
sequences would make this happen.

I gave a demo of the Knight TV system to Patricia Seybold; she published
some screen shots of it in the Seybold Report, and I have a copy of that
issue.  I'll see if I can dredge it up, scan it in, and send it to this
list.

  I've read the TERMS.INFO and ITSTTY.INFO files, so I have a good idea
about
  features.  They are dated 1985, but that could be different from their
  actual creation dates (because of backups or whatever).

  TERMS actually implies that a fair amount of modification went on, either
  with or without manufacturer support.  Mostly it was to get terminals to
  behave more like the ITS "reference" terminal, not to add fancy features.

The most notable SAIL deviation was that 0 was to the left of 1, which might
be mathematically logical but deviant nevertheless.

                     , except to add a few additional keys, the most notable

  Yes, the KTV is the one I was wondering about.  I understand the basic
idea
  of the extended character sets (how Control and Meta affect ASCII and how
  the modifier bits affect 9- or 12-bit characters), it's just the details
I'm
  trying to nail down.

The keyboard hardware interacted with the PDP-11 to generate 12-bit
characters;
the "standard" ITS driver then ignored the top 3 bits to get a 9-bit item.
If you wanted all 12 bits you could open the TTY in some kind of raw mode.
The only program I know of that took advantage of 12-bit characters (i.e.,
including TOP, SUPER and HYPER) was DRAW, the UI portion of SUDS (the
"Stanford University Drawing System"), an early CAD/CAM system used at both
Stanford and MIT to create schematic diagrams, from which could be derived
wirelists suitable for automated wire-wrap machines).  If you think TECO is
bizarre with control-meta-cokebottle commands, DRAW was much worse, since it
actively used SUPER and HYPER, too.  Very few people ever got good enough to
use DRAW; basically it was the realm of serious hardware hackers.

  There was also a BACK/NEXT key, I gather, and an ESCAPE key (different
from
  ALT MODE).

ESCAPE said "I wanna talk to the PDP-11", and was a lead-in to things like
ESC-C (complement black-on-white/white-on-black), ESC-nn-S (spy on buffer
nn),
ESC-D (open the door) and ESC-E (call the elevator).  In addition to the
video
switch, there was an audio switch, but it was never really made to work as
well
as the one at Stanford, on which you could choose among several radio
stations
and some other random sources of sound.  Since most Knight keyboards didn't
have speakers, and the monitors didn't either, there was no "bell" or beep
feature; instead the screen flashed from b/w to w/b and back to indicate a
beep.  I loved this silence, and miss it still.

BACK/NEXT mapped to the ^_ (control-underscore) character, which ITS used
for its own purposes.  ^_C23 would put you in "comm mode" (an early
version of what is known today as "Instant messaging") with terminal 23.

CALL mapped to ^Z, the interrupt character, which would stop a job and
return
control to the superior, usually DDT.

  I assume Top produced only the 33 extra characters you mentioned later?

I think only DRAW ever used Top and the bizarre characters.

  Did the KTV put out 8-, 9-, or 12-bit characters?

See above.  There were 7 bits for the ASCII character, plus a bit for
CONTROL
and a bit for META.  If you indulged in raw mode, you got SUPER, HYPER and
TOP, too.  The PDP-11 could tell whether you were using the left CONTROL key
or the right one, but nobody ever took advantage of that to my knowledge,
and
I don't think that info ever went as far as the PDP-10.

  If 8, then Top would be
  equivalent to Control (though the Top version of a letter could be
  associated with that letter, even if it was a Control version of a
different
  character).  Did the two-key equivalents of special characters (Control-Z
  and Control-_) quote their bytes with ^_?

If you typed Control-Z, you got a ^Z character.  If you hit CALL, you got
the special behavior of the interrupt character.  Likewise for BACK/NEXT/^_.
The printed representation was the same.

  What I would really like is a chronology of the various hardware.  I know
it
  went back and forth between MIT and Stanford.  And no one's mentioned the
  Grinnel keyboard yet.

SAIL had the first "bitmapped displays" similar to the Knight TVs.  They
had a many-headed synchronous disk drive to provide the video: a read-head
sent the signal to the display, and a write-head was connected to the
computer to generate the bits for the display.  Each display had one track
and two heads on the disk.  The odd thing about this was that the computer
couldn't read back the display, and therefore couldn't do funny things like
XOR a cursor into place without keeping a copy of the screen bits itself.
The Knight TVs, based on RAM, didn't have this problem.

Years after the Knight TVs, the Plasma Physics group (John Kulp) created a
similar setup.  They had a new batch of keyboards made to the Knight design,
and bought much more modern display-buffer technology from Grinnell.

  That would give you a character size of 6x11 dots with 3 rows left over.

That sounds right; the characters were basically 5x7 plus descenders.  Maybe
there were 44 lines?  The displays were like conventional TVs in that the
scan was interlaced; if you drew a picture that had horizontal bars one bit
wide across most of the screen you'd abuse the power-supply horribly by
having a heavy load on it for 1/60 of a second followed by no load for 1/60
of a second.  All modern computer displays are non-interlaced, but they
were essentially not available in the early '70s that we're talking about.

The niftiest feature of the ITS/Knight system were the run-bars at the
bottom
of the screen: a "bar" 32 bits wide by one bit tall lit up when your job was
actually running, and another one lit up when the system was busy fetching
pages from the swap area in order to run your job.  This was adapted and
extended by the Lisp Machine, to include a third bar showing whether the
GC was busy.  There was also a status line at the bottom of the screen, with
your terminal number, UNAME/JNAME/SNAME, %runtime, and size of your job as
a fraction (swapped-in/total size).

  It turns out my TECO confusion is mostly independent of my
terminal-handling
  confusion.  I have read through ITSTTY.INFO again and it makes more sense.

  I thought the set of input characters included Super and Hyper, though,
but
  it seems not to.

Super and Hyper were available in "raw mode" or whatever it was called.
TECO didn't go to those lengths.

  Obviously the resolution was much less.  I was simply thinking that you
  could have acceptable presentation for a reasonable cost (in added
  hardware).  I could be wrong though.

ESCAPE didn't send anything to the pdp-10.  It was processed entirely in 
the pdp-11.

The keyboard sent raw key press and release codes to the pdp-11, with the 
keys numbered by physical position, nothing to do with ASCII codes.  If I 
remember correctly a table lookup in the pdp-11 based on the key press 
code and the currently pressed set of shifts converted this into the 
ASCII-like codes sent to the pdp-10.  Don't trust my memory after 30 
years though.  Maybe some of the conversion was in the 8748 
microprocessor inside the keyboard.

Why should you care exactly how it worked?

    OK, this is just gross.   The very fact that I'm still on a list that
    talks about ITS is also gross, of course.  But DNS in LISP?

Okay, given that somebody just followed up to its-lovers (5 seconds
after I sent mail directly to SRA!), I guess I'll point out to the
list that Symbolics had both clients and servers for the DNS
implemented on the Lisp Machine.  One tricky part was making it
interact correctly the Namespace System, which predated the DNS, did
sorta the same thing for an individual site, and had very different
assumptions.  Getting the two to play nicely together was, well,
interesting.

Anyway, I forwarded SRA's message to the mailing list for Symbolics
alumni in case anyone there had anything to add; I assume he'll
summarize back to here.

My other response, of course, is, "Sure, why not?  After all, the
Lisp Machine had the -entire- TCP/IP stack, all the way from Ethernet
up through application layer, in Lisp, so what's special about the
DNS?  I mean, we had IP, UDP, TCP, DNS, XDR, NIS, NFS, Telnet, Supdup,
NFILE, DECnet, TALK (all 3 noninteroperable UNIX implementations, plus
lispm SEND), Dialnet (yuck---sorta like UUCP, kinda) and on and on and
on...  so many I've forgotten.  And they worked a lot more seamlessly
than most things do even today.  It was also kinda nice to have all
the Lisp Machines still up and running when the rest of the net was
falling over from the Morris worm...  Buffer overrun?  Stack-smashing
attack?  What are -those-?

[My original assumption was that "everybody on its-lovers knew all
this", because "they all knew about Symbolics".  But I guess we have
enough fresh blood on this list that this isn't the case---which means
the list is less insular than I thought.  Good!]

P.S.  Not to mention X.  Hoo boy, compiling X from its C sources using
the Lisp Machine C compiler.  What a trip.  Notice all the places
where pointers get cast to ints for a moment---which the compiler
dutifully complained about, because, after all, while the pointer is
pretending it's an int, the garbage collector might -MOVE- the object
the pointer was pointing at, but it won't update the int 'cause it's
not a pointer!  You can lie to the compiler about whether something is
a pointer or an int in C, but it's not exactly good form to do the
same thing in an environment with hardware tags and a GC...

Oh, right, not to mention that ARP was first designed by DCP for,
among other things, the lispm, if I recall correctly.  The relevant
RFC might be a useful reference on this.  (Anybody have any idea where
DCP is now?)

[And I hear lore that symbolics.com was in fact the -very first-

lispms didn't have a DNS implementation, the irony would have been
rich.]

       TARAKA?

   read Lord Of Light, by Zelazny.  the relevant file was CHANNA;TARAKA NAMDRG

That didn't seem quite right, I remembered that there were files with a FN1
of RAKASH involved somehow.  So I checked the source.  Here's the full
story:

At system startup time the system job loads the file SYS;ATSIGN DRAGON and
starts it up as a top level job.  That file is normally a link to
CHANNA;ATSIGN TARAKA, which contains a program that logs in as the user
"TARAKA" (see Zelazny).  TARAKA scans the "CHANNA" directory (see Zelazny)
looking for files with first filename "RAKASH" (which is actually "Rakasha"
truncated -- see Zelazny) which are each loaded and launched as demons
themselves.  The original TARAKA job then exits, but the demon jobs all
have username TARAKA and have jobname equal to the second filename of the
file they were loaded from.  Thus the file CHANNA;RAKASH NAMDRG winds up
running as the job TARAKA NAMDRG.

TARAKA NAMDRG (which was peculiar to the AI KA10 when the Knight TVs were
still working) would itself scan the CHANNA directory for files with first
filename of "NAMPIC".  These files contained the pictures that TARAKA
NAMDRG would display on the free display.

The file CHANNA;-READ- -THIS- contains the following ancient text
(modification date of 6 Jun 1975):

	  This directory is used by ITS for startup of
  various system programs; RAKASH * files are programs
  which, on system startup, ATSIGN TARAKA will load as
  system demons...  NAMPIC * are files which the NAME
  demon uses for picture displays.

Look at KSHACK; MINSYS 20.  This is the source code for the MINSYS
utility which actually builds the tape.  It contains a bunch of lines of
the form 

	defile dir,fn1,fn2,,sdir,sfn1,sfn2
and
	delink dir,fn1,fn2,,sdir,sfn1,sfn2

The 'defile' lines mean "write a file on the DUMPER tape named
DIR; FN1 FN2 with the contents taken from DSK: SDIR; SFN1 SFN2.

The 'delink' lines mean "write a link on the DUMPER tape from
DIR; FN1 FN2 to SDIR; FN1 FN2."

The fields dir,fn1,fn2 are always required, but any of the fields
sdir,sfn1,sfn2 may be omitted and in that case default to the values
given in dir,fn1,fn2 respectively.

I have a copy of KSHACK; MINSYS 20 if you need it.  I've also written a
grossly hackish script in Ruby[*] which builds a DUMPER tape in TAP
format from a file containing define and delink lines, if you're
interested.

[*] As an aside, I highly recomment Ruby as a scripting language for
munging PDP-10 files because it has built-in support for Bignums
(arbitrary length integers).  This means you can manipulate 36 and 72
bit quantities without pain.

Subject: ITS running on freeware emulator!

I am happy to report that I have managed to run a real, live ITS on a
freeware PDP-10 emulator!  (Bob Supnik's SIMH, version 26b).

>From my log file:
------------------------------------------------------------
Salvager 254

You're all alone, Fair share = 69%

------------------------------------------------------------

Words can't begin to describe how excited I am about this!  It's a
dream come true.

Getting ITS to boot and run on SIMH was a bit tricky.  There was a
small bug in the paging "microcode" (DBR3 and DBR4 were accidentally
swapped), enough of an DZ11 device stub to fool ITS was needed to keep
it from crashing on boot, and some support for RH11 commands 31 and 35
(write/read sector with headers) was needed to make the Salvager
happy.

Now that it's done, I would dearly like to share this with the ITS
community, which has been without a publicly accessible ITS hacking
platform for far too long.  Bob Supnik is working on integrating my
patches into the SIMH source, and I would like to put together a small
"bootstrap" distribution of ITS for public download.  This would
consist of:

	1. Bootable SALV and DSKDMP simulated tape images (RM03, RM80,
	   RP06, and RP07 flavored).

	2. A MINSYS tape with the standard MINSYS files *except* for
	   the INQUIR database (since it contained personal
	   information, and isn't necessary to run ITS anyway).

	3. The file AI: KSHACK; BUILD DOC

	4. Patches necessary to make the simulator run ITS, (until Bob
	   has integrated them into his mainline version).

	5. Additional setup instructions written by me specific to the
	   SIMH emulator.

My one concern in this is, what is the legal status of ITS executable
code?  Is there any legal or personal objection to my putting a
(binary-only) MINSYS tape image up for download? 

The larger question of what should be allowed to go into an ITS
distribution which is complete enough to do useful work is, of course,
a much more complicated question which will need to be dealt with in
time.  However, I'm hoping that a minimal MINSYS distribution which
can at least get a running ITS system into the hands of curious and
interested hackers is something which I can do immediately without
causing objection.

Question, how the hell did you get a working boot tape image?
I've been trying (and failing) to do it for... a long damn time.

I need to write one eventually anyway to get KS10 4469 working.

And seeing as I already have ITS on a CD, can you send me (or make
available) your tape images? ^_^

I may be able to hack the DZ11 code I wrote for TS10 (Tim Stark's KS10
emu) to work under SimH, and then someone could put up a real timesharing
box...

I am impressed...

That being said, my first thought is how can I get the thing on a RM03 pack
to bring AI back? Fall is coming, and this means I can open a window to cool
the computer rooms.

Well, this is because most TU77's seem to be dead.

You have a working tape drive? Bring it over to my house and we can spend a
happy afternoon cutting RM03 platters.

Well, I have a TU45, not a TU77, and I am missing the power supply for the
TM02. -_-.  Other than that, it's condition is unknown - I thought it was
broken because it wouldn't mount tapes, but that may have been because the
formatter was dead.

BUT - I do have a PDP-11/44 with a supposedly working tape drive.  I know
the drive works, and I'm not sure if the controller (TS11 clone by Emulex)
works though.  If it does work, I can cut tapes here in Peoria, given an
image.  I pulled it out of storage last night, it's at home next to the
KS10, and I gave it an initial check-out and it worked fine.  Will run
XXDP and suchlike on it later today or possibly tomorrow afternoon.

But until I get the missing RH11-C parts and a disk drive for 4469 it's
effectively useless except for emulation testing (which is what I'm doing
with it - Working at emulating the micromachine, because I want to
understand how it works)

John Wilson maintains an archive of ITS stuff at
ftp://ftp.dbit.com/pub/pdp10/its with everything you need to build
bootable ITS tape images.  You need to do a bit of hacking to get the
files into TAP record format used by the freeware emulators, though.

>I need to write one eventually anyway to get KS10 4469 working.
>And seeing as I already have ITS on a CD, can you send me (or make

Certainly.

Go to my ITS hacking page: http://www.cosmic.com/u/mirian/its/

This is going to my distribution point for my ongoing work with ITS.

The link labeled "ITS tape images" has the bootable tape images which I
used to bootstrap the emulator.  I built these from John Wilson's files,
which are already publicly available, so I don't see a problem with
releasing these.

Also available there are:
	* simh-its.patch - a patch against simh26b which is needed
	                   for ITS to run.
	* simh26b.zip - the original SIMH sources the patch was made
	                against.

	* its.init - a init file for SIMH which sets it up with the
	             tape images and "ITS" CPU type.

	* build.doc - the instructions on building an ITS, from
		      AI: KSHACK; BUILD DOC

I'm not putting a MINSYS tape image there until I know that it's okay
with the ITS community for me to do that.  However, since you already
have a copy of the ITS archive, you can build your own MINSYS tape with
my "genminsys" utility, also available off my ITS hacking page.  Note
that genminsys is written in Ruby (version 1.6), so you'll need to
install Ruby if you don't have it already (http://www.ruby-lang.org/).

I think I already have toys to mess with the various tape formats.

Right, I'll suck it down ASAP and hack away.  I had DZ11s working on
TOPS-10 under TS10 in about 2 weeks hacking time, so it shouldn't be that
bad.

Also, just so everyone knows, the place where I stored all my old computer
stuff is the subject of a hostile takeover attempt by one of the owners
against the other, so all my old computer stuff is getting moved to the
house (Because I can occupy the garage now. ^_^), catalouged, etc etc, and
whatever can be is going up on the 'net.  Things at work are finally
slowing down enough that I can get back into retrocomputing, and things
are already beginning to look up. ^_^

Greetings, all -- an update on the "ITS revival project":

Many people wrote me to congratulate me on getting ITS working.  Thank
you all for your congratuations and encouragement.  I appreciate it.

I was a little surprised that I got no response either way concerning my
question about putting a MINSYS tape image up for public download.  At
least, it doesn't look as though anyone has a major problem with it.
Therefore, unless anyone speaks up I am going to be adding a minsys.tape
to my files directory shortly.

New SIMH:

Bob Supnik has released a new SIMH with my ITS patches integrated.
The canonical location for it is 
http://www.tiac.net/users/mps/retro/sources/simh26b.zip

I have updated the version of simh in
http://www.cosmic.com/u/mirian/its/files/simh26b.zip to reflect that,
and I have removed the patch file, since it is no longer necessary.

Note that Bob's version has a different solution to the problem of
sector headers than I came up with.  I stored the sector headers in the
disk image file, and rewrote the code to read and write sectors to skip
over the sector headers on normal read and writes.  Bob's concern with
this, although technically correct, was that it would introduce an
incompatible change to the disk image format understood by SIMH, and it
would cause a flag day for people already using his emulator with
TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 disk images.  Furthermore, the sector headers aren't
really used by ITS except for disk verification (unnecessary for us
since an emulated disk shouldn't ever get disk errors).  So, his
solution is for write-with-headers to be a no-op, and read-with-headers
to be a normal read padded out to the correct length.  It is also quite
a bit faster than what I did (since I have to skip over headers, I can
only read a block at a time).

The upshot of this is twofold:

1. When you upgrade to Bob's new SIMH (which you should do, since it's
   faster and will be supported), you need to generate brand new disk
   images, you can't use ones from my patched SIMH.

2. After you MARK a new disk image in Salvager, and it asks you "Verify
   disk?", you should always type "n", since verification won't work.
   This is no big deal, really -- all verification does is test for disk
   errors, which you won't have on a simulated disk.  Everything else
   works the same.

Anyway... that's all for now.  I am currently putting together a
"cookbook" style set of installation instructions for getting a working
ITS system up from scratch.  After that, I would like to tackle the
problem of putting together a package of essential tools like MIDAS and
TECO.


Happy hacking!

I think that's safe to do.  My understanding is that ITS was writing with a
lot of federal gov't funding, so technically I believe it is not copyrightable
in the first place.  MIT's legal department may feel otherwise (big surprise
there), but anyway if I understand right they'd need to prove damages to
collect anything from you, even if their copyright claims *were* upheld.
Which will never happen, they couldn't possibly claim you hurt their ITS
sales, so you wouldn't lose your house even in the worst-case scenario.

Technically I don't think MIT even has the right to GPLify the code, since
they don't own the copyright to begin with.  IANAL and I may have some or
all of my facts wrong, but from what I've read, I really don't think so.

So I think the real question is whether any of the ITS authors would be
personally upset about their stuff being distributed.  My guess would
be no (since it was always available from the ITS machines themselves by
anonymous FTP), as long as you're very careful to only release system-y
stuff and no personal files.  The computing world isn't as groovy as it
used to be, and no one wants to put their email archives, love letters,
hate mail etc. where the world can see any more.

Putting just the OS and utilities up for FTP ought to be all right.  I've
never gotten any complaints about the boot files that are on ftp.dbit.com,
since they are definitely not in any gray area.

>Note that Bob's version has a different solution to the problem of

If you wanted to be anal, you could have it both ways and store the headers
in a second file, and use Bob's solution if that file is missing, and your
solution (but perverted a bit) if it's there.  That way the data-fields file
would be interchangeable, but you could be cute if you wanted to make it a
really close emulation.  The command syntax for attaching two files to one
emulated disk unit could be yucky though (especially if you want to allow
for other meanings of that, for example in my PDP-11 emulator I allow
multiple files to be attached to one disk unit so that you can concatenate
a bunch of files on the fly, and emulate a disk which is larger than the
biggest single file supported by the host file system, w/o resorting to raw
partitions).

I would love to hear how this goes.  I never got LISP happy when I had my
real KS10 running, because it objected to not being on one of the "known"
ITS machines.

Hmm, is the ITS disk format written up in plain English any place obvious?
I remember seeing mentions of TUTs and other odd things in there somewhere
when I had my machine up, but I forget where.  I'd love to add support to
PUTR for reading/writing ITS file systems...

Anyway, fantastic work!  I can't wait until I have time to try it out!
(Swamped this week though.)

This is a wonderful thing.  I've long wanted to have and host an ITS 
machine.  ITS has always had an air of mystery, and I think that has been 
partially why it never caught on.  You kind of had to join the cult to 
get very deeply into it.

What you're doing is a good thing IMHO because it changes the culture.  
In an odd way ITS was the most open of OSes.  If you could figure 
something out, you could probably do it, and respect came from hacking 
improvements to the OS.  There are a lot of parallels to this attitude 
and the Free Software/Open Source/Freeware philosophies.

Now if someone wants to bring up an ITS box, they don't necessarily have 
to know anyone special, or go through an archaic hazing ritual.  They can 
just hack, and there will be a community of people who will help them.  
This is how projects grow and thrive.

Now obviously the strong need for ITS is not the same as it once was.  
Sure there are some ideas that got their best expression in the code of 
ITS, and it will be fun to have good TTY emulation again, even if there's 
not that much that can be done with it.  

I am excited where this might lead, and who might play with it.  I am 
imagining ITS systems popping up, and people doing :SEND and :FR.  ITS 
was as much about communication as about technology.  

Thank you for doing this.  It is such a wonderful gift.

I'm probably going to hack all that out and put in working DZ11 code

It's just a matter of finding a machine to run ITS on now; Sakura hasn't

Since DSKDMP has started DDT running, you can take this opportunity to use

A MINSYS tape image is now available at 

	http://www.cosmic.com/u/mirian/its/files/minsys.tape

This contains the minimal system files necessary to bring ITS up in
multiuser timesharing mode, and load additional tapes.  It does not have
an assember or text editor, so it isn't really good for anything except
loading more software tapes.  However, if you can get your system to the
point where you can ^Z and get the "You're all alone, fair share = xx%"
mesage, then you've done most of the hard work, and you've got an intact
and working monitor.

I haven't had a change to write step-by-step installation instructions
specific to the SIMH emulator yet.  However, the file build.doc in the
same directory (a text file, not a Microsoft .doc format file!) is a
copy of AI: KSHACK; BUILD DOC, and will tell you most of what you need
to know.

I should mention, however, that the only disks I have managed to make
work completely are RM03 and RM80.  RP06 loses when I try to TRAN files
from the MINSYS tape, and RP07 works fine except when I try to do FESET;
then it gives me a checksum error when I try to T$SALV RP07.  I'm not
sure if the latter problem is the disk driver's fault or if the SALV
RP07 is bogus somehow -- more on this when I've looked into it.
However, an RM80 is more than sufficient disk space for playing with a
single-user ITS system.

I'm interested in hearing whether people have any luck getting a minimal
timesharing ITS working.  The step-by-step instructions are coming soon,
I promise.

I have the minimal system running.  PDSET does not work, I get
?NO ENTRY POINT
or something to that extent.
The symbols for this file are corrupt or missing.

I'm currently tossing together files from AI and MC to make a tape with
midas and emacs and such on it.

After that comes the DZ hacking. ^_^

I've run into the same problem; I don't know why.

As a workaround, you can start it manually by typing 215$G
(215 is the actual start location).

OK, cool.

Here's another something - Apparently itstar is making bad headers.
I get this sort of stuff on restore:

:DUMP
DUMP  .422
*** WRONG VERSION OF DUMP--ASSEMBLED FOR AI     BUT RUNNING ON DB     ***

_load merge noask crdir

TAPE NO      1 CREATION DATE  010827

BAD HEADER  SYS3   TS     .

and I can't get around it.

Can someone try this and make sure it's not just me?

It's not just you, I think ITSTAR disagrees with simh about how tape image
files look.  I'll fix it tonight, once I figure out what tape format simh
*does* use.  Right now I'm stuck trying to get simh to build at all, it's
totally bizarre, I get a krillion mysterious "parse errors" on perfectly
valid-looking code.  Is this a piece of known brain damage with the egcs
compiler on Linux?  I've had no trouble at all getting past versions of
simh to build on Linux with GCC.

I was able to work around this problem - once.  After running MARK, I
control-E'ed back to the "sim>" prompt, and did "reset all".  Then, I
booted the SALV tape again.  TRAN was able to load the MINSYS tape at that
point.  CHKD then completed without complaint.

I then used DSKDMP to create a new ITS, dump it out, and start it.  This
seemed to work OK, except that when I started ":PDSET", it printed a
message of the form "NO START LOC?"  I decided to log in, ran :PDSET
again, and it worked fine (though I did set the date back to 1991, since
it doesn't take dates in the year 2001).

I could not get :KSFEDR to run (as specified in the build doc), so I tried
it again from scratch, doing all the same stuff.  I got all the way to the
point where ITS started, and got the message about TARAKA logging in.  I
was going to try to :PDSET again, but now the system will not take console
input from me - I can type ":PDSET" (or, in fact, anything else I want),
nothing echoes, nothing happens.  If I go back to the "sim>" prompt, type
"set fe stop", and continue, I get dropped into DDT, and I can type there -
but can't get the system running again.  I am suspecting that I may have
corrupted my MINSYS tape image somehow...

I had the same problem.  I think it's because the files in the latest
sim26b.zip are MS-DOS text files (with lines ended by CR-LF).  The version
of unzip that I use has a "-a" flag to automatically convert text files to
"Unix format".  I was able to compile after I re-extracted using that
flag.

One other thing which is not mentioned in BUILD DOC is that you will
need to tell PDSET the correct century when you use it, otherwise it
will assume that it is in the 1900s.  You do this with the 'C directive.

So to set the time to today at 17:00 you'd type to PDSET:

Guh!  I discovered this a bit later, (after re-building simh 2.3d with no
problems and scratching my head a bit more).  I hate editors that hide the
^Ms in normal (non-UNIX) text files, they aren't doing anyone any favors!
I had tried feeling around for white space at the EOLs, to no avail.
Anyway this time I got some warnings, which concern me, but it did build.

I hit the same thing and I feel dumb for even trying it -- it's an emulator,
there IS no 8080A front end, and the emulated one certainly doesn't need
our help with feeding it a microcode file.  So the KSFEDR step should be
skipped.  I can't seem to get a bootable RM80 image though, once I shut the
system down I can't get it to come back from just the disk, I have to boot
the DSKDMP tape.  I'm also confused why the salvager runs unchanged under
the simulator even though I had to patch it to make it run on my real KS10
in 1993.  But then again I thought the current salvager was 260, not 255,
maybe this one is from before the bug crept in.

Anyway this is SO COOL!  I'm amazingly impressed.  Next step is of course
to haul my AAA out of the garage and plug it into my Linux box.  And I'll
get right on that ITSTAR thing.  Now I just wish I had a way to retrieve
the half-finished DELUA driver and Kermit server off of my RM80.  I have
some vague memory that I had a lot of customer work to do this week, but
it's fading fast!

Not quite; You need to do KSFEDR to get the disk pack to be bootable.

Besides, KSFEDR ran fine for me, with the exception that the filenames
provided by default had corrupt directories.

Should be fixed now -- ITSTAR V1.10 is in:

	ftp://ftp.dbit.com/pub/pdp10/its/itstar

It uses the Supnik header/trailer format by default now (I *really* wish
that misunderstanding hadn't happened, it's too late for either one of
us to change our tape formats to match each other), and concatenates the
headers with the file blocks like :DUMP does (I had misunderstood the doc
and didn't find out because :DUMP is easygoing about input).

This makes for an easy way to get files in and out, even if it's a bit
clunky.  The ITSTAR command syntax is a subset of TAR, so you shouldn't
need to read the doc file at all.

>Not quite; You need to do KSFEDR to get the disk pack to be bootable.

Guh, I skimmed that section when I saw RAM in there.  Dumb!

I must be doing other things wrong, because Something Ain't Quite Right.
Many programs give NO START ADDR? errors *some* of the time (including
LOCK which is irritating), and other times you get DDT BUG: PLEASE DO
:BUG DDT DESCRIBING CIRCUMSTANCES.  I'm willing to believe that egcs is
screwing with me, because it gave some really dumb warnings.  It doesn't
like the macros that make up MOVNI, because it claims the constant 2**35
is too big to compare to "ea", which is an int32, but it's just been
cast to int64 so that's crap (the compare will never come true but that's
OK, changing it to compare to 0 is definitely wrong though).  And egcs pukes
on a couple of entries in the table of powers of ten, even though they look
small enough to me.  Whatever.

[apologies for the previous blank message]

John, if you're using Red Hat 7.x, there are known problems with the gcc 
that shipped with that release.  If you do "gcc -v" and get 2.96, you are 
probably using a broken compiler.

If you install the "rpmfind" program, you will be able to find the "kgcc" 
package, which is gcc 2.91.  It may help you with your problems.

You may want to try:

   mv /usr/bin/gcc /usr/bin/gcc296

and 

  ln -s /usr/bin/kgcc /usr/bin/gcc

What distribution and version are you running?

Marty

I have RedHat 7.0, and I use kgcc instead of the broken gcc (In fact, I
removed the broken gcc binary and replaced it with kgcc), and I have the
same problems with LOCK not running (DDT BUG) and PDSET fouling up.

However, 215$G will start PDSET, and depositing nonzero data in location
30 of physical RAM makes ITS go down clean, so we have workaround.

Unfortunately, it's not fixed; I get the same BAD HEADER error now,
except that instead of locking up after the first block of tape is read,
it continues to the end of the tape.

I'm using Slackware (the number 7.0 leaps to mind, but I forget, I'm usually
much more interested in the kernels than the distros), it had egcs-2.91.66,
so just for thrills I grabbed the latest Slackware d1 package and got gcc
2.95.3 from there (as well as another egcs).  It gave the same behavior --
needs LLs stuck on a couple of constants in the power-of-ten table, and I
already fixed MOVNI so I don't know if it's dumb about the int64 cast there.

So I'm still getting the no-start-addr and the DDT-bug error, and the TOP
LEVEL INTERRUPT 40 message which I don't remember being normal on a real
machine.  Am I the only one?  If so, what OS/compiler combination *does* work?

I love this feeling!  I'd forgotten which control character gives a dir
listing, but my fingers seem to know.

Just as a point of reference, I've been using an iBook running YellowDog
Linux 2.0 for most of my work on ITS, and I have had only one issue,
which is that Bob Supnik's sources come with CRLF-style line endings
that confuse gcc.  But I just unzip with the -a option and it's fine.
My gcc is version 2.95.3 (20010111).  I've also run ITS on an Intel box
running FreeBSD 4.3 (i386, same gcc version) without a problem.

Subject: how were ITS distribution tapes made?

So, I've been working on putting together a "KS10 ITS distribution kit",
similar to what is described in AI: KSHACK; BUILD DOC.  The one part I'm
stuck on (at the beginning, under "Inventory"), is item #4: "Four DUMP
tapes containing sources and binaries for ITS itself, and various
programs including EMACS and MacLisp (Labeled 'Distribution tape #...')".

Can anyone here tell me more about the contents of these tapes?  Is
there a list of their contents anywhere?  I'd like to get something as
close as possible to an "authentic" ITS distribution kit.

Get the files in ftp://sakura.lunar-tokyo.net/pub/simh, put them in your
simh directory, recompile pdp10, and do "make dzclient".  Start the
emulator, make sure to "enable dz", and arrange for whoever wants a DZ11
session to run dzclient.

When connected to a dzclient, you have to push control-backslash or send
it SIGHUP to get rid of it.  XON and XOFF do not work because Linux eats
them.  I don't know how to get around this.

TRAN works with itstar, but DUMP doesn't.

But then again, I have AI's DUMP, and it complains about not bring built

to see if that works.

Lots of random stuff...

Lots of programs fail with ?NO START ADDR and the DDT BUG message.

I can compile a new ITS, but it won't run.
Here's the bughalt message:

 DSKDMP
nits
$G
 
Salvager 260
 
 
 
UY ITS 1644 IN OPERATION AT 1
RETURNABLE UUO FROM SYS OR CORE JOB,PC= 704000,,1
BUGHALT.  FIND A WIZARD OR CONSIDER TAKING A CRASH DUMP.
THE SYSTEM HAS CRASHED AND CANNOT BE REVIVED WITHOUT EXPERT ATTENTION.
IF YOU CAN'T FIND HELP, RELOAD THE SYSTEM.
YOU ARE NOW IN DDT.
BUGPC/   SWSCP9+10,,USRUUO+2   $Q-2/   CAIG U,760

And 0 contains this:

0/   JRST D,ASYSC

The supplied ITS seems to work OK though.

There's a filesystem corrupting bug somewhere.  Excessive use of TRAN in
Salvager will stomp on the MFD.

When the DDT BUG message starts to happen on one terminal, it spreads to
all the other terminals.

What was an Ann Arbor Ambassador?  DB has one at DZ port 7, apparently.

More to come as I see what I can and can't do...

Oh, and EMACS works. ^_^

I get the same thing, there's obviously something wrong.  Probably something
subtle, the system works way to well for some basic commonly-used instruction
to be all wrong.

>I can compile a new ITS, but it won't run.

Please, you mean "assemble"!  I'm surprised you got that far, I was glad to
see MIDAS come up at all but with all the DDT BUG messages I'm afraid to ask
it to do anything major.

I gotta ask -- how long did it take to assemble?  I remember ITS 1644 taking
about 1/2 hour on a real KS10 with an RM80.

>What was an Ann Arbor Ambassador?  DB has one at DZ port 7, apparently.

Nifty video terminal, available in many versions, generally with more lines
and/or columns of display than you'd expect, and nicely made keyboards.
I've got a 48-line old black AAA, and some newer AAA XLs which I believe
display 60 lines (portrait mode, they also made landscape terminals for
people who need to look at 132 columns w/o squinting).  IIRC the meta key
actually works right, anyway I used my 48-line one with ITS EMACS and it
was very comfortable.  They speak ANSI, but with a different mix of working
commands from the DEC VTxxx series.  MIT had a lot of AAAs so one weird
thing is that the ITS monitor has built-in support for the AAA, but NOT
the VT100 (so you need CRTSTY for that).

I used to have some Ann Arbor Terminals sales literature some place,
I remember it saying how proud they were of the fact that they'd never
advertised (so presumably all their sales came from word of mouth).
The terminals weren't cheap, I think I remember $1500 for the XL type things.
I suppose that's cheaper than a new VT100 was, but THAT was a mega-ripoff!

I kind of think the MIT folks got ahold of the AAA firmware sources (Z80???)
and had some fun with local mods?  Could be wrong.

>Oh, and EMACS works. ^_^

Does this mean you solved your XON/XOFF problem with the Linux TTY driver?
It should have been easy to kick the port into raw mode...

No, I meant compile, as in I could assemble ITS BIN, NSALV BIN and DDT
BIN, and compile the three together to make an ITS.

(As in a compilation CD, etc etc...  Is that the right word to use for
this?)

Well, my machine is a P233, it took me about 15 or 20 minutes or so.
So about the same.

The machine, if you are interested, is asuka.umtec.com, if you tell it
your name is "its" and no password it will give you a dzclient.  You have
to push control-backslash to disconnect.  ITS doesn't understand VT100s so 
you have to emulate a VT52.  Konsole (the kde equivalent to xterm) seems
to emulate an AAA, though, or at least it looks pretty when I tell ITS I
have one. ^_^ (Clearing the screen and so forth works...)

Oh, and since the simh variation of the DZ11 code only supports one board
at present, but the ts10 version uses all 4, if you get a terminal above
7, you lose.  You have to wait for someone else to free a port and try
again.

No, I can kick the port into raw mode, but Linux eats the XON/XOFF
characters in passing.  Or at least I got told that.  Something about not
being able to send ^Q to TOPS-10 when it was running under my DZ11 code.

The DDT BUG messages are almost certainly due to the fact that SIMH has
no 1-proceed support yet, which DDT relies on heavily.  Implementing
1proc is definitely in my queue for the very near future, unless someone
else beats me to it.

Hrm; I wonder if I reassemble DDT without the one-proceed, do they go
away? There was an option to do so when I assembled exec DDT, but it might
not give you that option if you are compiling a timesharing DDT...

Someone managed to completely hang the first DZ11 port; Can whoever
managed this please let me know how?  I can't tell if it's a DZ11
code bug or something other.

I busied out the port so it should work now.

I find it really eerie that, when I see the Salvager say something like
this, the first thoughts that run through my mind are all things like:
"check that the massbus cable is ok" and "make sure that the unit number
plug isn't falling out".

I actually have a massbus terminator sitting here on my desk -- but I guess
that won't really help either will it...

I dunno; I have the real thing sitting in my garage waiting for
parts; It's going to come up too, so the "real world" causes for some of
these message is going to be useful later on...

There's a processor test suite that runs under timesharing in the MAINT; 
directory.  It only tests KA10 instructions but it might find your 
problem.  However if the problem is in the I/O system you'll need to look 
elsewhere.

That's the original correct meaning of "compile" in the computer context. 
 It was corrupted to mean "translate source code into machine code" 
around 40 to 45 years ago.

I wouldn't mention this except that any group trying to get ITS up again 
obviously is not afraid of swimming against the tide.

I doubt that that is correct.  ?NO START ADDR probably means that the 
binary file being read by DDT was not in the expected format.  I.e. no 
start address was found after the binary data and either before or after 
the symbols.  The SBLK and PDUMP binary formats are documented somewhere, 
but I don't remember where.  That error message would happen before DDT 
attempted any execution in the subprocess, so one-proceed could not be 
involved.

DDT does not use one-proceed all that much anyway.

For the DDT BUG message, doesn't DDT dump itself to a DDTBUG > file 
someplace?  You could load that file into a subprocess (J$J $L filename) 
and try to debug it.  If you have the DDT source code it will be easier.

The ?NO START ADDR is not the message I was referring to (I agree with
your explanation of it).  In that case, I have no idea (yet) why DDT
can't find the start addresses in some PDUMP files and not others.

However, the problem I thought was likely to be related to 1-proceed
was the one which manifests in the message

DDT BUG: PLEASE DO :BUG DDT DESCRIBING CIRCUMSTANCES.

>DDT does not use one-proceed all that much anyway.

Hm.  But if it expected the feature to be there and it wasn't, what
would it do?

That's a good suggestion.  It looks like the files you are talking about
are in CRASH;; I'll take a look at them.

I would soon like to make available a DUMPER tape with some useful tools
for ITS.  At a minimum, I would like to include TECO, EMACS, MIDAS and
the ITS sources.

I have two questions:

	Would it be as simple as making a DUMPER tape containing the
	directories .TECO.; EMACS; MIDAS; COMMON; KSHACK; and SYS*;?

	Does anyone have any objection to my doing so, so long as I 
	take excruciating care to avoid including mail or other personal
	files?

I've just finished putting together a document on building an ITS system
from scratch, which is specifically targeted at the SIMH emulator.
It's intended as a companion to KSHACK; BUILD DOC, and it should help
out anyone who has been getting hung up on some of the differences
between the emulator and a real KS10.

The document is called "Building an ITS from scratch on the Supnik
PDP-10 simulator" and it's available from my ITS hacking page

John, just so you know, the bug with itstar and DUMP might not be your
fault; I tried loading tapes under TOPS-10 (trying to bring that up so I
can run the KS10 diagnostics tape from trailing-edge) and it can't read
tapes either, gives a flags error.  Obviously there's a bug with the tu
emulation.

TOPS-20 appears to get nowhere fast.  I couldn't even get /G143 to work
with version 4.1 of Tweenex, and the tops20v41 CPU option set.

I got TOPS-20 to come up, loaded the smmon diagnostics from the 2020 diags
GS tape, and ran everything I could.  Here's the list of failures:

In DSKCC, I get these two messages per pass:

PC =   032104
RESULT  = 000000 000007
C(AC) FAILED
FAULT NUMBER = CC2301
 
PC =   032230
RESULT  = 000000 000007
C(AC) FAILED
FAULT NUMBER = CC3701

Those translate to errors in FIX and FIXR's rounding, respectively.

DSKEB fails with cache errors (Duh, it's a cache diagnostic. ^_^)
Hit when mis expected, then it locks up.

PC=  031722
SWITCHES = 000000 000000
ERROR IN DSKEB - KS10 CACHE DIAGNOSTIC VERSION 0,1 - ACCUMULATOR TEST
 
ERROR OCCURED IN AC BLOCK 0, AC 0, ADDRESSING FAILED.
 
PC=  032044
SWITCHES = 000000 000000
ERROR IN DSKEB - KS10 CACHE DIAGNOSTIC VERSION 0,1 - PHYSICAL EXEC CACHE
CHECK
ACTUAL:   000000 010000
CACHE HITS WHEN MISSES EXPECTED

DSUBA is the UBA test.  It blows several pages worth of failures per pass.
A lot of nonexistent devices, a data error message, and some TOPS-20
paging stuff.

That was all, does any of that sound like likely causes for our ITS
trouble?

I have created a new mailing list:  its-hackers@cosmic.com

This list is for people involved in hacking ITS to discuss technical
issues, ask questions, and share code and advice.  Additionally, it will
be a vehicle for me to better support people attempting to build an ITS
system using my ITS starter kit and instructions, without overburdening
the its-lovers mailing list.

To subscribe, send an empty e-mail with the subject line "subscribe" to
<its-hackers-request@cosmic.com>.  The list address itself is
<its-hackers@cosmic.com>.  As an anti-spam measure, you must be
subscribed to the list to post to it, but there are absolutely no
restrictions on who may subscribe.

See you there!
