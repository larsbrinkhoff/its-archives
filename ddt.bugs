Boy are you ever right.  I can't tell you how often I have thought the same
thing.  But if you ever looked at the code in DDT that parses the argument
to :ALARM, you'd understand why I haven't done anything about it.

Subject: attempt to explain anomaly



I hope I can explain this .. :-)

Okay, I am working from my office here at the computer science dept,
at the University of Minnesota.	I usually use a z-29 in ansi mode, and
use the telnet program off our VAX/UNIX 4.3 bsd to connect to you.
	With that setup, I offer:
	
	When I telnet in to mit-ai, I am usually able to :login
straight in, upon which I am asked for my password and such. 
I also run the :CRTSTY vt100 speed 9600 
to set up my screen , without which I have serious trouble trying to
communicate with you.	

One one such session I was using the :telnet program and was trying to 
:telnet umn-cs 			(net address:128.101.224.1). 

I was able to get through and start up a session. When I logged out of
umn-cs, the telnet connection did not seem to break, (I did not get
back the telnet prompt or did not get back to command level). 

At this stage I waited for 5 - 10 minutes to make sure, that the
ethernet was not acting up strange and had for some reason a huge
choke of packets all accross the United States. After that I was
forced to get back to my own telnet and abort the session.


NOW.. what happened the night of the 
  
    Date: Sun,  1 Mar 87 00:26:42 EST 

I logged in and the first thing that I was given was some sort of
prompt that asked me if I wanted my detached tree attached. I did NOT
know about this detached tree until right then. So just for
curiosity's sake I did re-attach the tree, and then I find out that it
was that telnet job from the previous session. I was this time
successfully able to quit out of telnet. HOWEVER, then your system popped 
me straight into what I think is your mailer, with a prompt line that
said ... ( I am paraphrasing) :

bug: respond with :BUG-DDT DESCRIBING CIRCUMSTANCES

To me it was not clear wether I would have to type the whole line
after the second colon or just mail to bug-ddt and then describe
circumstances. In UNIX, we have a convention that the system prompts
with the exact format of response it wants. Any additional parameters
get either quoted or given secondary visual attributes. For example we
would say %mail BUG-DDT      <describing the circumstances>.

Nowhere did the system mention it had core-dumped on me!!

I was not even able to set up my screen and take proper care of
editing the letter to write a decent response. And then of course I
had to hit cntrl-c (I believe) to send off the letter. In unix cntrl-c
means <abort job>, and I had thought that would have done it. Instead
it mailed the letter, but did not say "response mailed" or any other 
confirmation message.
********************************************************************************
Devon, 
I assume you are part of the Systems Group responsible for ai.ai.mit.edu . 
In your letter you made quite a sarcastic ,and in my opinion a very rude 
response to my difficulties communicating with your system over the internet.

You will  say that I have made errors in typing in commands, and I would say 
rightly so, my unfamiliarity with your system and system incomptability lead 
to quite a big mess up.

BUT that does not give you the right to flame any person across the
internet just to satisfy your annoyance. 

At our systems group we try to be complacent with ALL user requests, 
however strange, routine or ignorant they might be. A lot of users
don't have the first hand contact with all the systems and are often
very infrequent users, and are even familiar with OTHER operating systems,
as I am in this case. At that stage we try to help them out with
information as much as possible.I sometimes get very annoyed at our clients , 
but they are what the group stands for ,and I always bear that in mind *first*.

Of course, since I am only a guest at your system, you do have the
right to terminate my priveledges, if that is your system policy and if that
is your wish.

I can be reached at the net address haque@umn-cs.arpa for further
comments.

   Upon logging on I got a message saying "DDT bug: please do
:bug ddt describing cuircumstances"  hence this msg.  

   I assume what's wanted is a description
of my sudden departure from the system before.  I was waiting for 
RMAIL, running under EMACS, to finish showing me a message. And waiting.
And waiting. Finally hit return or something, and got a note, probably from the TAC,
telling me that the host was unreachable. That  remained the 
situation for a while, so I reset the connection and had dinner.

Actually, the expiration date stuff is even more broken than I implied in
my previous message.  Basically, the expiration date on system messages are
ignored for any system other than the originating ITS machine.  This is
because as the message passes from one ITS to another it is given a
Recieved: line at the front.  Since system messages always have ITS-style
headers (COMSAT even manufactures once for system mail arriving with
NET-style headers), this results in a header like:

    Received: from AI.AI.MIT.EDU by MC.LCS.MIT.EDU via Chaosnet; 22 SEP 86  19:11:58 EDT
    DISTRIB:  *BBOARD

    ED@AI.AI.MIT.EDU 09/22/86 19:11:26 Re: New Technical Bookstore in Kendall Square
    Quantum Books...

which is confusing to many programs, including GMSGS.  Since GMSGS can't
find the expiration date, the message never expires.  Occasionally some
system hacker cleans the .MSGS. directory up by hand.

Someday someone should fix GMSGS and the :MSGS command in DDT, to
understand what hit them.

it was followed immediately by a DDT BUG: msg. only remarkable

Instead of completing at once as :GMSGS * usually does, it just sat there.

wanted my TTY.  I did $P, it told me there were messages, and then I got

OK this is it.  The migration of ITS system files from MC to AI is

having just moved Bug-ITS and Bug-DDT to AI, I thought I would test them by
informing you all of how this migration will work.  I expect to have most
of the SYS*** directories moved to AI by tomorrow.  If you have some
question about the status of a particular directory, look for a file on
that directory named " MOVED TO AI ".  If that file exists, then the file
you are looking for now lives on AI, edits on MC are likely to be lost.  If
that file doesn't exist, then MC still has the master copy.  In any case,
if I am logged in, be cautious about timing screws.

    Any time someone who existed but had no directory nor login file
    logged in, :INTEST would cause a bug (dunno why).  But it's a stupid
    thing to have at the end of an init file anyway, so I changed it to
    :VK.  Voila -- no more bug.

Cretins everywhere.

Gumby you are a cretin because you didn't bother to look at the
documentation for the :INTEST command before you flused in from the USERSn
init file.  It is perfectly reasonable to put :INTEST in your init file.
It simply means to do a bunch of default login actions like doing a :MSGS.
You also lose points for not bothering to track the bug down.  Take a look
at the routine DBGHAK in DDT to see how easy it is to do.

The bigger cretin is the cretin who implemented the :MSGS database library.
Guess what happens when the database gets bigger than the file that
contains it?  Right, it starts getting MPVs.  Just a little time bomb
ticking away waiting for the 506th user to run :MSGS or :GMSGS.

I expanded the size of the database and put the :INTEST command back in the
USERSn init file.  I didn't fix SYSENG;MSGS.

I got a send from someone via mail because I'd logged out already. 
The return address (From: field) was of the form

FOO at MC.LCS.MIT.EDU

which is illegal these days, the current format only allowing the
@ form (Foo@MC...) Because of this replying to the message didn't
work.

        I have consistently been getting
        PURPG; 70105>>.CALL 70247 (SIOT)
        messages tonight, while trying to use my usual :CRTSTY IQ120.
    Nothing has changed in the installed CRTSTY on MC since July '85, so this
    looks like a DDT BUG.  Other people have recently been reporting the same
    error message for any terminal setting.

That message is unlikely to have anything to do with a DDT bug.  

Looking at the CRTSTY binary reveals that 70105 = FTLINT+4.  Not having a
crash dump I can only guess what the fatal interrupt was, but an IOC error
on the DSK channel seems like a good guess given that the CRASH; directory
is full.  I'll clean up CRASH; and we can see if the problem goes away.
(I'll prune CRASH;CRTSTY LOG while I am at it...)

And, no, I have no idea why this shows up as a PURPG, perhaps somebody
would like to try debugging it rather than crying wolf and pointing fingers
at other programs.

[ And anyone who assembles the current CRTSTY source should be aware that
  they are debugging changes that GUMBY and KLH have made since the last
  binary was made. ]

In ITS version 1552 (now running on AI) the %PIJST interrupt is finally
implemented:

Typing ^_J will give the job that currently has the console a %PIJST
interrupt if it has it enabled.  If that job does -not- have %PIJST
enabled, ITS will check to see if its superior does, or if its superior's
superior does, and so forth, up to the root of the job tree.  If nobody is
willing, the ^_J is treated as if it was an illegal escape sequence.  (It
echos as "^_?" in that case.)

So its time finish the code in DDT to actually handle the interrupt.

It seems to me that the unix people have this one right -- this should
be a piece of user code, not something stuck in the middle of DDT.

Of course, were it in DDT you could have a variable containing the

I'm sure I wrote this at Ellen's request and she put it into the init files of

the :reattach program should be part of ddt so it doesn't say

And PWORD too, it can ask you for your password and then run it.
Maybe it should just know to not give the message, otherwise
running the reattach program as usual.

:alarm is completely confusing.  If it made some attempt to check it's input
for meaningful vs meaningless jcl, there might appear to be some rhyme or
reason to it's seemingly random behavior.  :alarm followed by four spaces
seems to do something (don't ask me what) for instance (no <return> needed!)
and if you give it back what it output, ie, :alarm .+8:00, it acts weirdly,
taking the : as a terminator.  Yech.

    By the way, how does the system know about sharable pure pages?
    If it knows that much why doesn't it know about binaries' filenames?

It's because the concept of a "file" exists only at a higher level of
abstraction than the level where page sharing is done.  Sharing is done at
the level of pages and disk blocks.  A file is a name for a sequence of
disk blocks, but there is no way to go backwards from a disk address to see
which file (if any) it came from.  (Other than mapping over the entire
filesystem.)  If there was some reason this operation needed to be done
with great regularity, the information could be saved.  But it is rare to
want to do that, so we don't.  

(I actually have a tool that does it since I needed it once for debugging
disk ECC recovery on AI.  I think there might also be a routine in the
version of the salvager that runs under timesharing that does it.)

    I snarfed an emacs from a hactro and tried to do <alt>G
    "no start address" I don't know if this is a DDT bug or an ITS bug.

It isn't exactly anybody's bug.  The start address of a program is treated
just like the symbol table.  It is stored in binary files for the benefit
of people who load, start, and/or debug the program, but it is not kept
anywhere in the job itself.  ITS doesn't concern itself with where you
think a job should be restarted.

Now it -is- a little inconvenient that there is no way to go from a random
job you find floating around the system back to its binary to find its
symbols and starting address.  So let me float a few suggestions through
the air and see if anybody thinks they are a good idea:

(1) Add a user variable that would contain a starting address.  This would
    cover the common case that Devon complained about.  (Happens to me all
    the time too.)

(2) Add four user variables that would contain the filename of the binary
    for the this job.  This would enable symbols to be found as well as the
    start address.

(3) Add a user variable that contains the address of a block in the job's
    address space, in some extensible format we design later, that contains
    all kinds of information.  Like a vector of start addresses, filenames
    of binary files, etc.

(4) Since (3) requires cooperation from the job itself, but (1) covers the
    most common case, we could do both.  One user variable containing a
    start address and one containing the address of a block of information
    (or zero if the job doesn't have one).  Note that these are both 18 bit
    quantities, so this really only adds an extra word to every set of job
    variables.

A problem with (3) and (4) is that the new info-block user variable seems
somehow redundant with the existing use of the left half of .40ADDR.  The
16.-word block addressed by LH(.40ADDR) is currently only used for
temporary hacking by a job's superior; perhaps there is some way to combine
the two?  Perhaps one of the words addressed by RH(.40ADDR) can be the
info-block pointer if the job sets some bit in .OPTION?

I guess I'm in favor of at least (1) if not some variant of (4).

    Why can't send use :CHSEND when you give it a non-local user?
    ie instead of :send  foo@zermatt bar doing :mail, why can't it do :chsend?

I'll guess that you are complaining about the built-in DDT :SEND command?
If you set ..SNDFLG non-zero in your init file, then :SEND will run the
SEND -program- which knows all kinds of ways to reach people.

I would set this switch non-zero by default except that it is occasionaly
a feature that J. Random Luser can :SEND a message to a wizard when the
system has no free job slots.

(Note that even if you set ..SNDFLG you can still use :OSEND command which
is just an alias of the :SEND command.)

    How could I tell that CRASH; was full?  EVERY DDT was acting that way,
    and there was no way to shut it off.  It didn't occur to me to look at
    CRASH; at all.

Well what does it -usually- mean when someone can't write a file on ITS?
It means a directory is full.  I didn't expect you to do anything when
-every- DDT was acting broken, I expected you to look after the machine came
back up.  I figured that since you wrote the crash file to GUMBY; rather
than CRASH; that you had noticed that something was wrong with the latter.
(If that is really not the case, let me warn you that it isn't a good idea
to write out files under exec DDT to directories other than ., CRASH,
CRASH2 (when it exists), and CSTACY.  See CHANNA;RAKASH DMPCPY.)

DDT should probabyl have a feature where if it has crashed dumped itself
once in a session, it should never bother to do so again.  Future errors
would cause it to just explain to the user that his DDT thinks it is broken,
but there is only one crash dump per customer.

Regarding all the crashes I've been causing.  It appears to be because
there is some bogus limitation on the number of additional symbols
one can tell DDT about itself.  My init file happens to use that many 
plus about 5.  An easier way to reproduce it is to do
	:xfile dcp;ddtbug xfile
in a fresh DDT.  I would appreciate it if this bogus limitation 
were made non-existent, or at least larger.

Oh yeah.  Until I get back into microcode hacking again, hackers who debug
programs using DDT on AI will find that features related to single stepping
don't work right.  I'll fix it eventually, I just haven't put in the

I won't be fixing the fact that AI doesn't have a MAR, so somebody should
be fixing DDT to know that some ITS machines lack the feature.

Reply^K was failing for me with fully formed messages from OZ and HT
(coming up with Author?).  I can't reproduce it now, so maybe something
else was wrong. (possibly the messages from WGD in my sends file with an
unknown host name in the header?).

At the time I was getting the 'connection waiting for response to SYN'
errors from sending to WGD@24512/chaos, the microwave link was up.  I ended
up supduping to OZ and sending to him with no problems.

Btw, in the case of unknown hosts, the messages come out like
TTY Message from chaosnet site 24512/CHAOS
User-Name@WHAT-THE-HOST-THINKS-IT-IS-CALLED ....

It would be nice if reply put together the User-Name from the second line
with the host number from the first line.  (Maybe it does but whatever was
screwing things up for me that night screwed this up also?)

    How come :REPLY is not hacking normal net sends anymore? 

I don't know what this means, but Gren suggests that you are referring
to the fact that most 20X sites dont put any header on their outgoing
sends, and REPLY cannot read minds.

    Also, how do I send to  a chaosnet host number?  I tried WGD@24512/chaos
    but it said connection waiting for SYN or something equally unlikely for
    a chaosnet connection.  The machine in question is receiving send
    connections just fine, since I was able to send there from OZ.

:S WGD@24512/CHAOS works OK for me; it tries to connect to Chaos
address 24512.  It fails, since the microwave to SCRC is more or less
permanently down.

Sometimes when you are debugging two jobs that communicate with each other
you want to single-step one of them without giving it the TTY.  Well, I

    INQUIR seems to give people with a "Z" designation (clinical decision

    Enough occasional and small users from AI use MC now that I was
    getting tired of using INQUIR to manually force their home directory
    to be AI0.  This morning I taught INQUIR that if an "A" person comes
    along who does not have a directory, it will automatically stick them
    in AI0 (rather than USERSn).  Of course, if AI0 starts getting too
    full due to many people, we can make more dirs.   But I don't think
    that's too likely since most AI people with alot of files have their
    own directory and don't need to use AI0.

Well, more than just AI users seem to have their directories changed, so I
retracted the new version of LSRTNS, reassembled DDT (being careful to
increment the version number this time) and installed it.  The buggy 
ATSIGN DDT was renamed to be ATSIGN XDDT.

Since you sent this message while logged in as TAR0 I'll make a guess about
the nature of the problem.  If you are logged in as TAR0, and still logged
in elsewhere as TAR, and you try ":CHUNAME TAR" it will fail because you
can't be logged in twice with the same name.  (I don't think it would be
reasonable for :CHUNAME to go and gun someone named TAR just because you
wanted to be logged in under that name yourself.)  In that situation
:REATTACH is usually what people want.

Of course this is just a guess.  If you weren't still logged in elsewhere
as TAR, then there would be a bug.

[ Bug-DDT: It would be nice if DDT gave an explanatory error message in the
  case outlined above, rather that just cryptically saying "?". ]

A random wanted to create SYS;TS ATHENA so he did:

Since :MOVE just opens the input file, sucks out the bits, and then does
DELEWO, this had the same effect as

:MOVE SYSBIN;SUPDUP BIN,SYS;TS ATHENA

which broke all of the other supdup aliases.  Perhaps :MOVE should check

    Barf.  I was faked out today by DDT not understanding how to assemble typed
    in KS IO instructions properly.  The random kludges necessary to get the
    traditional IO instructions to type in correctly (like "CONI 4," which does
    not put the 4 in the same place as "MOVE 4," does) manage to screw the new
    RDIO/WRIO instructions.  Apparently DDT just checks for ones in the top three
    bits of the opcode to determine that it should do the kludge.  The effect
    is really confusing if you don't know whats going on: you type 
    "RDIO 2,100000" and the answer appears in AC 4.  Perhaps somebody else on
    KS-ITS who wants to help us out would be willing to stomp out this buglet?

    Timesharing DDT has the same bug almost.  It masks out the low two bits of
    the AC field before putting it in the wrong place.

    MIDAS does the right thing by making the kludge a property of the symbol
    rather than a property of its value.

I believe that the right way to fix this is to check whether bits 0-8 of the
word are equal to 700 when storing the AC field.  If they are, it's an old-type
I/O instruction and the AC number is really a device number and needs to
be shifted.  If they aren't, it's a normal instruction and the AC field is
an AC field.  Probably DDT currently checks bits 0-2 instead, but that's wrong.

    Now all the winning things have been fixed with questions and logout, how
    come the  in my logout file gets printed?  (as in:
     u
    MC ITS ....
    ?)

1.  Thats not the ^W in your logout file being echoed.  Thats caused by the
    fact that you have a matching ^V at the end of your LOGOUT.  Remove
    that ^V, and you won't have anything to complain about.  (Don't ask
    what causes it.  Its not something recent either...)

2.  If you try logging out sometime when you don't have an E job at all, you
    will be surprised.  I think there is probably a bug with JOBP here, but
    I'm not planning on looking for it.

3.  Its probably a bad idea to do a :JOBP E in your logout file in the
    first place.  Suppose you have an Emacs job with something valuable in
    it, but you want to log out.  You do :DISOWN to disown the Emacs so
    loggin out won't kill it.  You type $$U.  Your LOGOUT file then does
    :JOBP E, reowning your Emacs.  Then when you get logged out, your Emacs
    job gets killed.

4.  WHat happens if you have an E0 job?

5.  If I were you, I would write a little program in Midas to run in my
    LOGOUT file that performs the test you really want (look for jobs whose
    superior is the correct job, whose XJNAMEs are "E", "EMACS", etc. and
    put together an appropriate string to .VALUE), rather than trying
    to get DDT to do it for me.

Certainly that wouldn't be acceptable since it would then print out a ddt

zero out TTYFLG.  Best would be for unexpected messages of the form
--Despite pending braindamage?-- to make sure they are always seen so that

    It would be nice if, when I log out DDT would run my LOGOUT file before
    checking for jobs with their ..safe set.  I have a logout file that looks
    for an E  with its ..safe set, and zeros it before logging out.  This
    doesn't get run until I've already been asked "Kill protected job?"

Related problem:  The --Despite pending alarm?-- message you get when you
try and log out with a :ALARM still waiting to go off happens after your
logout file has been run.  According to Gumby's reasoning this is better
than having it run first, because then your LOGOUT can check for that
occurance.  Unfortunately there is this other bug where if your LOGOUT file
uses , as most do, the --Despite pending alarm?-- gets asked INVISIBLY!
Of course it is still waiting for a confirming space character, so it looks
to the user like his LOGOUT is just hanging.  If anybody does anything
about this, they should deal with this problem as well.

The :EXISTS at the end of your login init leaves a random value lying

    If I run :babyl it says almost immediately:

I had never seen DDT say "CHECKSUM?" until this afternoon, when I tried to

read SULLIV's message.)  Ling it again worked.  I didn't even know that
this message was in DDT's repertoire of complaints.  I suppose this could
be a tremendous coincidence...

    ...  I've also noticed that if I type a number

What does it mean to "type a number then a job"?  If I type 105E or 105:E or

unusual happens to me.

When I log on, something strange happens somewhere.  I'm not sure what
causes it; probably something in my login file (it's not the cleanest
thing you've ever seen).  Anyway, the first job I start after the
login file ends always aborts for one reason or another.  If I start
off with Emacs (GSB's E version) it prints the header then it says:
 NOS? :INPUSH    102010
It can be $P'd and it then works normally.
If I run :babyl it says almost immediately:
^V  CHECKSUM:INPUSH
This is totally damaged, and I have to $^X. and start again.

If I type a ^L before doing any of this, it types: 4000000 what I
first took to be an open memory location.  But there is no slash.  If
I type <cr> either before or after ^L, the first job doesn't lose.

This has only been happening for several months.  I first noticed it
after a new version of DDT was installed, although I'm not sure other
things didn't change also.  I've also noticed that if I type a number

    I *still* don't understand how, interrupt-level echoing aside, input
    can be echoed back out of order!  Why why why?

I guess I don't see what you are asking exactly.  Perhaps if I explained
step by step how Devon's complaints happen:

    Date: 15 April 1984 14:44-EST
    From: Devon S. McCullough <DEVON>
    I suppose this is pretty well-known by now, but for the record, due
    the the various ways characters get echoed, if I type F ^L ^K I get
    ^KF!
    at the top of the screen, 

This one is easy.  Devon types F^L^K very fast.  All three characters
echo immediately.  Since the way ^L echos is by clearing the screen, he now
has a blank screen with a "^K" in the upper left-hand corner.  Now DDT gets
into the act.  DDT reads the F and stores it in some kind of type-in
buffer.  Next DDT reads the ^L.  Since DDT knows that ^L clears the screen,
it redisplays what is in the type-in buffer.  This causes DDT to print an
"F" after the "^K".  Finally DDT reads the ^K, prints a "!" and starts the
program.

			      and if I type E ^H ^X R I get
    *^X ^H R
    after my * prompt, until Emacs gets around to clearing the screen.

To understand this one you have to understand that DDT performs a kludge to
cause ^H to appear to echo as "^H" rather than by backing up a character:
When you type a ^H it actually echos by backing up, but when DDT reads it,
it corrects this by moving the cursor forward one position, and then
outputting "^H" (ugh, what a kludge).  So in this case Devon types E^H^X
which all echo immediately, which on a terminal with overstriking leaves
him looking at "^X" because the "^" overstruck the "E".  DDT now reads the
E and the ^H and performs the ^H kludge resulting in "^X ^H" as the
display.  If the next thing Devon types is R, and if he really then sees
"^X ^H R", then I suspect that the EMACS that is now running has probably
output a space (I can't exactly reproduce it because it depends so
critically on timing that I can't control).

Not really a DDT bug.  Almost every program on ITS exhibits some form of
this behavior.  Its what comes from letting ITS echo your characters at tty
interrupt level.  Programs can prevent it from happening, if they want, by
requesting main program level echoing (like 20X -- ITS gives you the
choice) or echoing characters themselves.  The default is interrupt level
echoing, and most programs don't bother to request anything else.

You can think of it as a feature: it lets you see your typeahead rather
than hiding it from you until your program actually eats it.

    Trying to rename DNRF: to DSK: on same directory gets me
    CANT RENAME TO ANOTHER DIRECTORY.

If you do :CALL RENAME you will find that this can't possibly be an ITS
bug.  If you were using DDT, then it is DDT's problem.

    I thought that XMAIL$$2^F should set the default from BIN to XMAIL.
    Maybe that part of the code is buggy.

    I am not sure that PFILE1 is being used in all the cases
    where it should be.  In particular, if I do ":PRINT FOOBAR >",
    then "$$1^F" does not look for FOOBAR.  Since there is something
    already in that DIRFN1 slot, it ignores PFILE1.

You are very confused.  Which is funny, because you wrote this code!
Furthermore, if you go and look at the code now, you will find that I have
completely re-written it, and that I have taken great pains to duplicate
the very feature you are complaining about here because I thought you
thought it was a feature!  Rather than de-tangle this through the mails, we
should talk about it in person.

In MC:CRASH;DDTBUG 12 under ITS 1365...

I got a DDT BUG as I was attaching an accidentally detached tree.

Just before the tree was detached, I had been in Emacs. The Emacs had 
realtime interrupts enabled for a mode line clock. I don't know if 
that was related, but one of the first things the tree did upon attaching 
was to do buffered redisplay of the mode line.

Also, the system went down (scheduled, not crash) shortly (2 minutes)
after attaching the tree, so the crash might also have been related
to some interrupt about the system being about to go down that came
to my job either while it was detached or as I was reattaching.

Actually, I would much rather have a hack where if DIRFN2+2n is non-zero,
then typing FOOn would always set PFILES, while if DIRFN2+2n was zero,
then it would set PFILE1.

Hmm..  Actually, what you REALLY want is to be able to specify individually
for each entry in the DIRFN* table exactly how it should behave.  Hmm..  If
nobody minds I will hack in a feature like this when I have a free hour or
two.  I'll try and be carefull to allow everybody to get the behavior they
desire.  (And I'll try to do it in such a way as to not break anyone's

I took some suggestions from KMP and have implemented mostly upwards
compatible extensions to $$^F.  These changes allow you to type the
names of simple variations on the DIR: frobs you have put in the
DIRFN1 table (so you don't have to patch as many things). Also, you
can change your default SNAME as well as default FN1.

If the DIRFN2 slot is zero, if there is no argument, we use the
default FN1; else if there is an argument we use it and set the
default FN1. This is like before.

If the DIRFN2 slot has something in it, if there is an argument we use
that argument instead of ignoring it like we used to.

You will also notice I changed the DIRFN1 table to the settings that
many people (including me) had patched in their DDT init files, and
also made the table a little bigger.  This is NOT compatible with the
older $$^F behaviour!

DIRFN1:	SIXBIT /NAME1/	;Table of $$^F DIR: search options.
DIRFN2:	SIXBIT /UP/
	SIXBIT /FIRST/	;$$1^F finds FN1
	0
	SIXBIT /SECOND/	;$$2^F finds FN2
	SIXBIT /BIN/
	SIXBIT /CDATE/	;$$3^F ascending in creation age
	SIXBIT /DOWN/
	SIXBIT /SIZE/	;$$4^F descending in size
	SIXBIT /DOWN/
	SIXBIT /NOT/	;$$5^F not backed up
	SIXBIT /DUMPED/
	SIXBIT /ONLY/	;$$6^F just link pointers
	SIXBIT /LINKS/


Examples:

FOO1	Shows DIR:FIRST FOO and sets FN1 to FOO
LISP2	Shows DIR:SECOND LISP
2		Shows DIR:SECOND BIN
3		Shows DIR:CDATE DOWN
UP3		Shows DIR:CDATE UP
PACK136	Shows DIR:ONLY PACK13

The following is an experimental feature I think I like; it needs to
be turned on by setting DIRDIR.  $$^F (without a numeric argument)
does like $$0^F, except that it uses the argument (if any) as the
default ^R SNAME to set.

Examples:

$$0^F		Does                                   DIR:NAME1 UP
$$^F		Still does                             DIR:NAME1 UP 
KLOTZ$$^F	Changes default dir to KLOTZ and does  DIR:NAME1 UP
DOWN$$0^F	Doesn't hack default dir (KLOTZ), does DIR:NAME1 DOWN

These changes (and ALAN's recent ones) will all take place when I
install DDT and update the documentation.

Perhaps someone will explain just what it is that everybody thinks ^Z is
supposed to mean when you type it directly to DDT.  I know what ^D is for,
and I know what ^G is for, but as far as I know DDT doesn't do anything
special for ^Z other than the kill-ring kludge for the SEND command.
Before deciding what ":MAIL FOO^Z" should do, a more coherent theory of ^Z
must be designed.  It's a pretty silly thing to waste time about anyway
given that it can only work when DDT is a toplevel job.

You see, I'm always afraid that using ^O to delete my mail file will cause me to lose

Ok, folks, so what state is DDT in now wrt $$n^F?  It sounds useful,
but this $$440700^F seems a bit cumbersome for folks like me to use.
Or was it a joke?  I vote for $$n^F where n selects one of a limited
set of things.  This sixbit stuff seems ridiculous -- why not just use
^R and the dir device and access it symbolically?

Subject: $$^F

I often do <name>$$^F only to get nothing, because I'm defaulted to the
wrong directory.  It would be nice if I could then do <dir>$$0^F and
get what I wanted from the first command.  Just plain $$0^F could also
default to my HSNAME.

Right now I think $$^F and $$0^F are identical, but I suggest that
$$^F should remember the last function selected and do that.

Instead of $$0^F selecting for <FN1> and $$1^F giving a wide listing,
how about $$0^F selecting the directory (think of it as <fn0>)
and $$1^F selecting for <fn1> (consistent with $$2^F for <fn2>)

The old behavior is preserved by initializing the sticky $$^F function
to select <fn1>.

I un-de-generalized the code for $$^F so that you can make all
the FN2s zero and get the default.  Ie., you can put searches
in slots besides $$0^F.  I also increased the size of the table
a little bit.

$$0^F  FIRST <foo>
$$1^F  NAME1 UP    (verbose listing)
$$2^F  SECOND <bar>
$$3^F  CDATE DOWN
$$4^F  SIZE  DOWN
$$5^F  ONLY LINKS  (had to put something here....)

You were right about cstacy's n patch being ridiculously
ungeneral.  I talked him into something nicely general and
doesn't require users to be patching DDT in order to make use
of its full functionality. Under the new scheme, you say

		namen

where name is the fn2 to give to DIR: and n is sixbit for the fn1
to give. So, for example, 

	UP434441644500	;to get a CDATE UP listing

gives you a CDATE UP listing. Also, the numeric arg is now sticky
(initially defaulting to 465162636400) so if you specify

	FOO or FOO0

you get the default. This was easy to put in since 0 didn't
designate a valid filename anyway.

Here's hoping you're satisfied...

In DDT 1440 on MC:

In a moment of randomness, I made a minor extension to DDT's $$^F
directory lister command, and tested and installed it on MC.

$$^F (or $$0^F) does the same thing it always did.
$$1^F does the same thing too, except that you can now patch in a
total of three DIR arguments (starting at DIRFN1+2 and DIRFN2+2) and
do $$2^F and $$3^F.  (In other words, $$n^F searches the two-word
entry table at DIRFN1 and uses the specified DIR names; the table is
currently 4 long, allowing you space for three numeric argument
options. An argument of zero is ignored.)

I put this in because I wanted to use the DIR device more often.
The default listings you get now are these:

foobar$$0^F DIR:NAME1 foobar
$$1^F       DIR:NAME1 UP        verbose directory listing
$$2^F       DIR:CDATE DOWN      sorted by recently created files
$$3^F       DIR:SIZE  DOWN      sorted by biggest files

    Somehow, right after I wrote the original message, I thought it was a
    little cryptic.  Sorry about that. What I have is a file MBECK BIN, the
    output from MIDAS. I knew how to load it into core ( MBECK$J $L MBECK
    BIN ), but don't know how to take a core image and stuff it back onto
    the disk with the 'adjustments' I made to the core image. I ran into a
    problem with this program and was trying to run a modified version of
    it.  But this program expects to have been run using :PROGRAM <text> as
    opposed to PROGRAM^K . I couldn't figure out how to use :PROGRAM <text>
    on an in-core program, hence my message to you.

i'm afraid that this is beyond my knowledge of ddt. perhaps someone on
one of these lists can help you..

There are an absurd number of CRASH;DDTBUG files on MC.
If someone thinks they have an algorithm for reaping these other than
the one I am about to employ (flushing all but ones from this week), could
they enlighten me?

For no obvious reason, my login init file, BEN;BEN LOGIN,
no longer tests the terminal speed and initializes my terminal
as it used to.  It does the other checks for mail, so it is
being run.  What's up?

This doesn't seem to work anymore.  It behaves exactly like ..SENDRP/0,
i.e. all messages are repeated each time you get a new one, until you
get back to DDT.   I think it used to work once.

In DDT 1437, ITS 1348, on MIT-MC:

Something peculiar happens with more processing in XFILEs.
MORWARN acts differently towards :IF MORE 0 under conditions
which look the same to me.  In partcular, an XFILE containing

..MORWAR/-1
:IF MORE 0

acts differently from the more useful case of

..MORWAR/-1
:IF MORE 0
    (:STUFF
    )

The first example gives the user a (Space=Yes, Rubout=No) prompt, and
the second does not.  It's not clear to me if this is supposed to work
at all for "artificial" more breaks.  It confused a user (me too!) who
was trying to write an init file for someone.

    Is there an OZ: device?  If so, how is it used?
    Thank you.
    -- Steve

There is not, although I might write one. (I started writing one
a long time ago and did not finish.)  Those magic devices use a
special protocol which only ITS systems have implemented.  To
make an OZ device requires writing a different program for a
different protocol.

I was reading my mail using BABYL, and received one of those YOU HAVE MAIL breakin messages, when my line was disconnected (by an incoming phone call).  When I reconnected the line, I got a DDT BUG: message.  Hence this bug report.

I hope not.  If you want to completely reset things why don't you use U.?
I believe that then offers to re-run your init file.

    Inqupd is writing out its new database to LSR1 >.  When it runs out of
    disk space, it closes the incompletely written file.

I think I have fixed my brain damage INQUPD.
Now it writes out the provisional version to NLSR1 >, and disk-full
interrupts prevent it from installing it (the interrupt handler had a
bogus instruction in it.) It will still leave the incomplete version
around as NLSR1. Later, I will put something in to get this deleted.

    In this case, DDT loses its ass when starting up when not-logged-in.
    It bugs out before it gets the system symbol table mapped in,
    making debugging incredibly difficult.

Maybe DDT should do all its initialization before logging the user in
(and needing to find his hsname.)  I thought it already did this,
but will look at.

    When CORBLK is doing block-mode map-from-disk, it apparently just
    tics the aobjn pointer away leaving MPV pages after end-of-file;
    no indication that you ran off the end.

Is this an ITS bug?

    I made two invalid assumptions when looking at this broken system
    this afternoon, which caused me to believe that it was horribly trashed.
    (Maybe it is.  It crashed randomly twice before, which lent great credence
    to its being trashed.)  One was that DDT would not fail so grossly with
    the inquir database smashed.  The other was that corblk would not 
    intentionally act the way it did.

ML *is* having some kind of trouble - COMSAT is repeat processing
messages from May somehow. I guess the QML is broken somehow?
Was it restored from tape, or is something even worse happenning?
See BUG-MAIL.

    I have renamed INQUPD BIN to INQUPD FUCKED.

I put the current database and program on ML.
Let me know if there are more bugs with it (it ran fine for three
weeks on MC, but of course some of the error code did not get
exxcercised there.)

The "provisional" inquir database gets written out as LSR1 2.
The "installed" one is LSR1 1.

Surely you jest.  This is a joke, right?  Just to keep me on my toes?
To make sure i don't forget how to look at pdp10 machine code with
a fucked up ddt?
