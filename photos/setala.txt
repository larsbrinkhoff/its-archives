Yes. I did visit MIT AI LAB back in 1989.

I had been a "tourist" on the MIT-AI ITS machine and had a chat online
with RMS, and he created an account for me on the prep.ai.mit.edu VAX
back in 1985-86 I guess.  However, I was arrested because of hacking
the Finnish university network, So I decided to use different names at
that time.

Then in 1989 I had a business trip to the U.S. and managed to persuade
my boss to take a trip through Boston, we decided to stop by MIT and
try to go to visit mr. Stallman.

However, it happened that he was visiting Finland that time (yes I'm
from Finland), so we didn't meet. But as we went knocking the door,
Leonard Tower Jr. opened the door and gladly gave us a tour around the
AI lab.

Here's a session log I found from my archives, it's nothing much than
reading the bboard. I'm still in process going through all the old
boxes full of printouts.
