(0:00)
OK, this is Rick Greenblatt,
and we're here in the office on Tuesday,
May 23rd, 2006, and we're looking
at video clips and we looked at
clip number one and that was Minsky
holding forth on Winston's thesis,
and then there was a second section.
Narration by Dave Walz also
talking about towers and cubes,
and one thing another.
And then you had mentioned that the black
and white was from the 3:40 deck display.
(0:34)
That's right, there's quite a few of these
clips in here that are black and white.
I think you'll be able to recognize them
have been shot off of the three forty.
The 3:40 was an interesting
piece of hardware. It it.
It did not have a raster,
it it had random access to flexion.
And of course with the cathode
ray tubes and magnetic deflection.
You know it's it's a lot of work.
(1:00)
You've gotta change currents
in these big coils,
which is not easy to do,
so it it it was a 10,024 by 2024
resolution thing and it could deflect
any point on that in 35 microseconds.
So for our purposes here in terms of trying
to catch a little bit of the history,
the most important thing is that
that black and white display is
one of the earliest displays.
Well, actually it was, it was.
Actually,
there were others earlier that this.
(1:31)
This one was represented.
A significant refinement in
that kind of a thing.
The PDP one that the digital PDP one
had a Type 30 display which had a 50
microsecond random access deflection.
And also this this 3:40 that we're talking
about had had a a vector generator.
It had a character generator
and it had an incremental.
(2:00)
Increment generator OK,
so each of those were interesting as
we're looking at any of black and white,
we should be aware that the the stuff
itself is captured by a device that's
off historical interest in a way.
Yeah, I would say it is and it would
just photograph right on the screen.
You know, just with a camera, no no separate.
Well we had a hood.
I think that sat down over at some of them,
some of that.
Some of this may have been done using
that hood, but it was pretty cool.
Should.
(2:30)
Well,
actually you'll see a picture of it here.
So yeah,
let's defer that discussion in second when
we actually have the picture in front of us.
Yeah, we're looking at tape two and the first
part connecting these circles here is a hack,
I believe,
by mikes pesner mikes pesner SPECINER,
and I did contact my special are
just recently and just advised
him that this stuff was on.
(3:01)
Available on the web.
So if you get in touch with him he may
have had a chance to look at it and
may have some comment about what it is.
What's interesting here?
He is around and he is active in the
MIT Alumni Association so you can
reach him through through the yeah.
A good source for take two for the first
part of tape two and also the second
part of tape to the second part of tape.
Two is is a simulation called gas.
(3:33)
It's it's it's.
It can be recognized by this.
This is funny thing here.
In these circles bouncing around there,
they're their molecules and.
He had a fairly efficient thing for its time.
It could, on a fairly slow machine,
could simulate a fair number of these things,
and when they hit off of
each other they bounce,
you know properly as being circles
and so forth, and you know,
like balls would deflect off of each other.
(4:02)
This guy is very familiar and I can't
remember his name I I wanna say Solina wins.
I have no idea if that's the
correct name or not.
Micah Bell Gospar yeah Bill Gospar IIII.
Contact with and he he's he's
on tape quite a few of these and
and we can you can reach him,
but this particular fellow at the
end of this is in the middle of tape
two and it's it's just after the
two cuts on on mikes pesner thing.
(4:36)
And. He has a contour thing here.
What's being displayed here?
Is a early program that could take
an image and plot contour lines.
And. I had one of those two which.
They also look fairly similar to that,
but it was later, I think.
(5:04)
OK,
now these people on the Bongo
board I I don't know.
There's another cut that is a bongo board.
Yeah. Ask was there?
Yeah on shorelines klotter yeah.
And. Yep. Yeah.
Then there's a very short clip of me.
(5:34)
Sitting here just sitting in a
chair and scratching my back
or doing something. John.
Then here we is just a
shot of of of the demo.
Apparently this is Marvin Minsky here
standing in the door and the arm is
in the process of doing something.
This this arm you see here and you'll
see it in several of these other
clips is is referred to as the AM
Farm American Machine and Foundry.
(6:12)
Foundry arm and this.
This was a a factory arm designed for
for use in in in in industrial order.
Just started automation.
Well, fairly early it was.
I don't know exactly first but
but it was it pretty serious.
(6:33)
I mean American machine and foundry was,
uh, you know, uh?
Fairly here, fairly, you know competent
company in terms of milling machines,
and I don't know what all making devices.
And so they made this thing, and it had
a controller that was quite amazing.
It had, I don't know if I would go into
the details of the controller. Anyway,
we we they gave it to us at some point.
(7:00)
We junked the controller and
we re interface the arm.
It was a hydraulic arm.
It it had a 5 horsepower motor in it,
so it was quite strong. Dangerous even.
It was cylindrical coordinates.
And it it it based? It was controlled by.
These hydraulic servovalves there.
(7:34)
Very, very sensitive.
They can be controlled by just a very
small amount of electric power and
and and and and you know, deflect.
Hydraulic oil and so forth and,
and of course, it,
like all hydraulic devices, it it.
It was occasionally,
occasionally with spring leaks
and spray oil all over the place
and do things like that.
Anyway,
this particular clip Minskey is
just looking on at the thing while.
(8:04)
A demo is being moving and here in the
also in the doorway we see someone else,
which I'm not. Quite sure who is.
We might be able to figure out who that is,
but probably not worth trouble.
OK, now here it looks like we're doing
a a thing called Tower of annoyed.
This is just a a blind.
Manipulation of blocks.
Attached to the end of the arm.
(8:31)
We have a uh, hand.
And this this hand.
Was oh another persons name I might
mention in connection with this
arm is is Russ Nosker Russ Naskar,
who was the administrative officer in in
in the early days of the AI lab also.
FTSKER
so.
(9:04)
At at very, very early days,
that's right, so we're talking about 65.
Yeah, actually we we might.
We might even a little earlier he was.
He was around right when he eat often.
Well, not quite there. No.
Actually we can talk about that too,
but let's let's not to push down in this.
(9:33)
So anyway, we also had a hand
and this this hand, I guess,
was made by Naskar and.
And. Oh yeah, Wichita guys.
Bro, let's see Bill, not Bill Roe.
Something wrong I think.
James probably pop into my mind anyway.
We had a, uh, another couple of guys who.
(10:01)
Essentially did physical and and and
servo electronics type of things and
printed circuit boards and kind of
that kind of stuff in those days.
Anyway, what we're seeing here
is is just a very trivial.
Hanoi Tower of Hanoi thing
and and it's just open loop.
There's no vision going on here
that the the it's just assuming
that it where it puts it down as
it will remain and it goes back
and picks it up and so forth.
(10:30)
So that was a simple thing to program.
OK, now this next clip. Here we is.
A very interesting clip.
It's it's. It just it was.
Yeah I don't servo handle it.
Yeah it was electric. It was not.
The hand was was was entirely
electric based on stepping motors.
It had.
You had given the other,
some of them did have names that one was
just sort of the hand of the AMF arm,
so that one didn't have it
separate name that I recall of.
(11:10)
OK, now this next short clip here
is A is of something called it.
It's the Minsky Bennett arm and
it's it's a very interesting armor.
It's sort of an elephant
trunk like thing it has.
I think it's 4 links.
And each link has two hydraulic cylinders.
(11:33)
Also has two linear pots to provide feedback.
And it it kind of has a bone and
and joint type of construction.
Here there's no sliding action to it.
And in this case it just has a fake
human hand attached on the end of it.
There were attempts to make a somewhat more.
(12:00)
Real Handforth, but it's actually quite a,
uh, it's also hydraulic.
But the bottom line of it was that it
was completely beyond the software of
the time to control it, so it it was.
It was made and it was flexible and
and we had this little moment here,
and some of these pictures you can see.
Uh, a little analogue of the arm being
maneuvered and that was coupled to
the arm and that would you know allow
a person to to to maneuver it around.
(12:37)
But we were never able to to
do hardly anything under.
Program control just due to
the fact it was just.
Require too much programming and so forth.
Now this next clip.
Is 2 famous hackers of the era on the
left here is Alan Kotok who is kidding.
(13:05)
I've worked with Alan and W.
3C. Yeah, yeah and.
And this is Alan Kotok,
actually early in the in
his prior life when he was.
No, no, the that was his.
He wasn't president with Robert prior life
or even maybe three prior lives, but he was.
(13:30)
A senior hardware engineer at at
Digital Equipment Corporation and this
this clip is in PDP six days so the
PDP six was designed like many deck
projects of that era by two engineers.
One senior in one junior.
The senior engineer was Gordon Bell.
And and the junior engineer was was Alan
Kotok on the PD and Alan later dust the deck.
(14:03)
10 that's right, yeah, and.
And no OK the the other person
here is is a famous person.
His name is Stuart Nelson and he's a.
T. Nelson or otherwise known as in hack.
And. He's also had quite a
career in doing various things.
Could go into for a long time.
(14:30)
We probably better not.
OK, they're they're sitting here at the 3:40.
Far OK, yeah, and there's just.
There's some other clips that
are better of the three.
OK now here is we're going back
to the Bennett arm and here this
very petite young woman here.
Very cute is name is Lucy and
she was Marvin secretary.
And being as small as she was.
(15:00)
It turned out to be a a a very good
fit for this Minsky Bennett arm.
Here a kind of a cover has been
placed over the arm so she won't
get caught up in it and take the
arm in and then she can just sort
of ride it like a elephant trunk.
That's the whole idea.
Was holding a tire or something?
No, that's the arm and that's
that's flexible and it's.
And it was able to to give
her quite a nice swing.
(15:35)
Yeah, she rides on the arm and yeah, yeah.
Minsky Bennett arm.
Yeah Bennett was this bill Bennett was
the machinist who made this argument.
It was done.
These bones of the arm were were
machined out of solid aluminum blocks.
So and and represented very elaborate
machining for the day and so forth.
(16:02)
OK, and now this next
thing is the waltz finger.
And I didn't remember too
much about it except it,
but that Dave Waltz.
Again, we we we mentioned,
and this is attendant operated
finger and it has.
It's actually pretty winning in its way.
Unfortunately, as far as I know,
no, no software and it never got.
(16:35)
Integrate with anything but you.
See you see here.
Well you see it's it's.
It's a finger it's got attendance
here it's got 2 pulleys.
Over here and then it's also got
some some joints and it's also
got a a thing here on the top.
So it's it's here.
It is gripping a little clip.
Lead the fingers there it is open
and then he puts a just a wire
in it and the finger is able to
reach right around.
(17:01)
Yeah, and what did you lose?
Dave waltz.
Well, yeah.
And. And then then,
at the very end of the clip we
get a a very short clip clip.
Of a simulation on the 3:40.
Of of the Shirred loop program.
SHR Dlu and that was a program.
(17:32)
Our deal you should loop and that effort
was actually a collaborative PhD thesis.
Yeah, I think each each of these
guys did their PhD thesis on this.
Terry Winograd.
Did the natural language part this.
This actually had a a quite an
elaborate natural language thing for
its day and program itself, I believe,
is mentioned in the AI timeline.
(18:02)
The triple AI timeline.
Very likely it is,
so it's kind of natural language interface.
Yeah, that's the courtesy of Winograd
Gerry Sussman, who is still here,
of course, and so on.
I did did a thing called micro Planner.
In part and and also another part of that
was done by fellow named Jean Czarniak.
So this is the total program Trudeau,
which contains a natural language
component from Winograd and the micro
Planner component from Jerry's,
US right and and and and also it can
contribution from this gaijin czarniak.
(18:46)
Yeah, and Czerniak is a is a brown and has
been for many years, is that spelling?
Czerniak ayaka something like attorney.
(19:03)
Yeah, and his contribution to Trudeau was,
oh, I think it's something having to do with
semantics of of of the semantic part of it.
Hi, this is John Gray. Hi.
OK, can you go real quick?
OK. OK, I'm gonna I'm I'm here for awhile.
(19:36)
I'm in a meeting with.
I thought it was very good.
Gonna take as much as I can get OK.
Alright bye bye. OK, this next clip.
Ginger czerniak yeah, and he has had
a full career at Brown University
and and and he's been associated.
(20:03)
Well, I think I don't really
remember that that clearly.
I think he had something to do with
the semantics of of the language,
semantics, interface or something in
addition to micro planning, you may
have also contributed to micro planner.
The three of them sort of worked together,
yeah? OK, yeah, so that's yes,
that's a lot of stuff.
Yeah, OK, then the next clip,
which was oh three, yeah?
Or one really is just kind of 1 clip
and that's all we actually was.
(20:38)
Two clips it it was the Minsky clip and
then it was the the walls narration.
And an 02 had had had a quite
a number of clips there 03.
I really should be broken out.
O2 should be broken out into these
little pieces of stuff because you
ever involved in separate projects,
I guess so, although some of them are very,
very short,
but still
is an important piece of.
(21:08)
Well, there's more stuff
there's better clips of Shilu
later in this thing though,
so I don't know if the genesis
really want to get Shirley from there.
So this is, yeah.
Film #3 that yeah well film #3 I have
already over and film number three was was
more of Mike's best and there's gas and.
(21:32)
And I think it was mostly gas actually.
So I basically spent near Saks,
so I've moved on here too.
With four and for the first part of
the clip is is actually the AMF arm.
Doing the the so-called copy demo,
which was the big goal supposedly and then.
And that was gossipers programming largely.
Then we go to the second clip,
which is this onscreen simulation
of scherdel and this also.
(22:08)
Yeah, right, right, that's right,
and you can see here that it it it
simulates on the 3:40 a a very simple
arm that can kind of comes down and
sticks to the Cuban and picks up
and has a a number of cubes here.
And you can say pick up the red cube and
put it on top of the the the blue cube.
(22:30)
One thing another and it it.
It knows that you can't put
things on pyramids.
It's actually fairly smart in its
way here and the English language.
It says find a block which is taller than
the one which you're holding and put it into
the box so it can do quite a bit there.
That that was pretty impressive
in its way OK.
Then let's see the next.
This is more shared Lu and
another another clip of of Shilu,
yeah?
OK, now here we go with some chest.
(23:03)
Now at this next clip we're
see we're seeing the.
Yeah, and the first thing we see
here is the Model 35 teletype.
And this was the main console
input of of the PDP 6 and then.
Then here he's sitting and there's
the 3:40 there. There it is.
What we're talking about and
it's set up for chess here.
He's got a.
We've got chess on the screen and and
the person here is Alan Baisley and
Alan Baisley is is another long history.
(23:38)
He was a.
A very strong chess player and
unfortunately had some medical problems
and whatever, which is a long story.
OK, let me interrupt you for just a minute.
Kotake courses still is here.
Yeah, he's accessible to me.
Yeah, he showed up in that little clip.
Is he also knowledgeable about this?
Whole Ryan?
Not very much, no, no he isn't.
(24:00)
He just happened to be visiting that
thing and we caught him on clip.
He he was not actually part of his he he was.
He was around the model railroad
club in those days.
I knew him well and so forth.
But yeah, but but in this
function here he was just sort of
paying a visit to the customer,
having recently delivered his machines.
Go down that rabbit hole.
Just be your own information are
you have you talked down lately.
(24:32)
Oh couple weeks ago.
Organs to pipe organ. Oh no.
Actually, I didn't. We didn't.
We didn't discuss that,
so I didn't want that.
Yeah, OK, so this is chess playing and
this is basically sitting in this.
They're playing my chess program this
this is Mac Hack chess program and.
It it just showing a little bit
of the operation. Now here is.
(25:02)
Here is another shot of
the Council shot program.
Since they're playing it can you 1968?
Well, in the 65 it it could have,
it could have.
This isn't PDP 6 era so it's pretty early I.
I think it's probably 65 or
66 kind of area. Oh
now here we see a shot of the console
area from the other side, so here's
basically still sitting at the 35 right?
The Type 340 is here,
right immediately to the right of
the extreme right of this thing,
and barely visible at all on the screen. OK,
then we see the actual console area itself.
(25:42)
Here's the lights and switches
the machine had here and then.
Here are the deck tapes.
These little deck tapes, the deck.
Each of these deck tapes held
64 K words of 36 million words.
So it was actually a a a non sequential
device where the other peculiarity of it.
(26:03)
Well it it was addressable.
That's right you you could write in
the middle which you could do another.
Really. That's right, that's right.
OK and I imagine additions of duct tape
up here which is a magnetic medium.
There's probably a paper tape running
somewhere around the teletype, no?
The paper tape was built
into the processor here,
so we can barely see it actually.
Now just to the left of the lower
micro tape is the 400 character per
second paper tape reader and then this.
(26:37)
This item here just to the left
of the upper maintenance panel.
Here is the burpee 60 character
per second paper tape punch.
And those were both built in to the PDP 6.
And. And they were very similar to the
corresponding items which are on the the.
(27:00)
The punches are out.
So the the yeah the the computer is
using punch tape output and input input.
Yeah, in an earlier at this era it
looks like we were on micro tape.
I mean in the very earliest days
of the PDP six. Of course the
micro tape software wasn't ready.
So in that case we were
completely based on paper tape.
So when you're saying micro tape,
that's not the same as dictators.
Yeah it is. It's exactly the same.
(27:33)
There was a a copy mark dispute
and and and deck had to rename it.
There was somebody else had
copyrighted that word or something?
OK, yeah, there's a light here,
which is sort of preventing us from
seeing the other pair of microchips.
This.
This machine had a total of
6 micro tape drives in pairs.
Deck tape drives again the same same thing.
(28:00)
And this right here is just a blank
panel where where they still.
This is all still in the chess playing.
That's right, this is.
And since we get a shot of it
here we we should probably take
advantage of it to just describe now.
Now the going on here to the left,
from from the console part of the processor.
Is. Two whole bays which are the processor.
This this next Bay here immediately to
the left is the central processor itself.
(28:35)
And then the next thing is.
The fast accumulator's the holbay
worth that is 16 registers.
Which was the fast accumulator's and
then further and then the next two days.
Here are the memory that came with the
machine from deck the the this was 16
K of 36 bit words crossed $120,000.
(29:11)
And then sitting out here at the far end
of the line is the fabric Moby memory.
And we we just get a little view of that.
It's very likely that at this time,
this mobile memory wasn't working is
another long story where it it it?
It took a couple of years,
or at least a year and a half to get
it to work after it was delivered.
(29:33)
It later, however, became very reliable
and was very central to our whole
operation of the lab for many years.
It it it, it cost it was 256
K of of 40 bit words,
of which 36 could be used,
and it costs $385,000 from
fabric tech it was.
(30:01)
Well, that's what we've,
that's a that's its name.
That's what we called it and and Moby was is.
Is is a you know is a Moby Dick?
Sort of a large and and it has
some other connotation to it.
Yeah so. You guys designed it.
No, no. We bought it.
We bought it but it was a
very special purchase it at a
very certain particular time.
(30:30)
The Office of Naval Research and DARPA.
Predecessors and so forth who are
funding all this stuff had came
up with some extra money so they
they said OK, MIT and Stanford.
We've got 400 grand and you you each
get 400 grand to to do something with.
So basically we took this 400 grand
and and contracted to get this
Moby memory and company again.
Was fabric fabric tech fabric tech.
(31:01)
Patrick fabric tech.
They're making this was a core
memory you know, made of of,
of of little Donuts and it's
it's big feature was that it was
a two wire core memory.
In other words,
most core memories of the day had four
wires going through each of those
individual tiny quarter quarters.
And this this memory with somewhat
more elaborate electronics.
(31:30)
Managed to work having only two wires.
Per going through the course so that made it,
of course much easier to have small
cores and and and have a lot of
them and string it so that that's
in the way in which The thing is
is that the core is holding a.
Magnetisation running one way
or the other way.
Yeah, doing as you're reading.
You're you're reading it with one wire
and you're writing it with the other one.
No, it's more complicated now.
But but basically, yeah.
(32:03)
But the conventional core
you see this memory yeah,
so the ratio of prices we can see.
In other words this this memory on
the end here was 16 K of memory.
It cost 120,000.
Right and and this is 256 K.
2 bit word 3636 so the PDP 6 is a
36 bit machine and it had parity
as well so it was actually 37.
(32:32)
So this is a foggy death now,
is it using this guy is using
3 bits to do something with
the two wire thing or no no.
The the two bits were unused.
You know they they they
for almost all purposes.
Actually they were wired up and
there was a very few things.
But your point is that we're
getting 16 times as much memory
as much for twice as much money
or three times as much money.
That's right.
That's right so.
(33:02)
OK, so anyway that is the movie memory OK
and and and then he goes on and plays a
little bit of a game here and that's it.
OK, so let's let's now go on to clip #5.
You are programmed to do chest.
Yeah, all this memory was essential for.
Ah well, actually no.
I mean, of course there's different areas,
and one thing that no,
the this guy eating up the whole
machine when he's playing shows
it looks like we probably were.
(33:35)
As well as the.
Of course, that was the thing.
There was one this one machine
for the whole laboratory and
in the in the earliest days.
It was used by 1 user who who
was actually sitting sitting
there manipulating the switches.
You know starting stop and yeah
on the switches. Unable to hear.
The machine and and hear errors
in the code as the thing goes by
whether or not it's true, but well,
there was a music interface,
so the way you could hear it was
that that that the lights would be
connected to this audio amplifier,
and depending on what's happening.
(34:16)
Again, it may be a funny story,
but what he's talking about
is like switching.
Off the machine itself,
if you were sitting at late at night,
you could hear sometimes that you
had made an error in your code.
(34:31)
Well, you can hear it.
I mean, it's the same thing I think.
I mean, sometimes you just,
although it's a music interface,
you see the music interface consists
of simply hanging an audio amplifier
and off of the light driver so.
Depending upon what's going on,
there may very well be a yeah yeah, alright.
So this is Phil #5.
OK now film #5 is is mislabeled here.
(35:01)
It is not actually primarily life.
There's a guy named Roger Banks.
Who was a PhD student at the time?
And I'm not in contact with him.
I haven't seen him for a long time.
And this is.
This clip is mainly his stuff and.
So yeah, he's he's doing a cellular
autonomous automata simulation here,
and he has a general scheme by which
the cellular automata can can build
whatever you ask it to, you know,
and so that's what's going on here.
(35:41)
Changes it's not the game of life,
it's a general purpose, cellular automata.
It's general purpose and it's it's
been designed, specified to, uh, uh,
to have a particular property of being able
to to by means of this elaborate scheme,
build whatever logic you want.
(36:02)
You know from a electronic input
from essentially a program.
In other words, see in other words,
what's going on here?
You see, you have a a thing at the top,
and the thing at the bottom.
They're both shooting at each other,
depending depending upon the exact
timing of of of those relative shots,
it either meets and goes out and and
and adds a thing to the arm or it.
Retracts and and doesn't or
at leaves USDOT at the end.
(36:32)
So you see it's it's able to
build a general pattern here,
which it's illustrating by by making
the letters MIT eventually here.
Alright, so OK.
So so so it's able to sort of configure
itself for for for an arbitrary
this is the work of Roger Banks.
Yeah, 'cause this thing show up as a
as a his thesis with a name later.
Ah, I think as part of his thesis
he he also worked some with Fredkin.
(37:04)
Although he was he was largely,
fredkin was interested in
cellular automata 2.
Roger Banks was mainly before Fred
Cannon and I don't think you know.
I mean was it was sort of a
colleague type or informal.
Interactions, far as I know,
but he played played on here with Tom.
That's right and he went to be you and John,
his Norman Norman Norman goals, right.
(37:31)
And then Tom.
Eventually when I would be you right?
OK, so now let's go to clip.
Patients to listen to what's
his name on Volinsky while also?
I gotta did math. Well.
Oh, ten years and then came back out.
Well, let's see.
There's a couple of them and there's some
things here we'll see in this thing.
(38:00)
In any case, he has his whole
home of redefining the universe,
and everything is basically cellular.
Thomas, he was down at NSF.
I was at NSF for several years, Wolfram.
When he was back, yeah well no bother to me.
Well from actually was not at MIT.
Primarily Wolfram came out of Caltech.
Well, he went to a mountain top
for 10 years and rediscovered.
And doesn't give any reference
to Toffoli or any of them.
(38:33)
Can I call them on that?
No, that's right. That is true.
That is true all right.
OK, now this this is the Ernst.
Well, well, I actually.
I'm not sure what this is.
Now I take it back.
This may not be.
This looks like our blocks.
Oh by Roger Banks phone number
six film #7 is an arm and.
I'm not even sure that it's here,
and this might be the Stanford
armor or someplace around.
(39:09)
But it does look a little the
block sort of looks familiar.
The arm doesn't. So I'm not.
No. Would they have replicated?
No, I don't think so. It.
Anyway, yeah, that's that's more of that arm.
(39:30)
This arm is also, oh,
here it is putting a thing through a peg.
I'm pretty sure that that was Oh yeah,
on this crank thing.
I'm pretty sure this is Stanford arm.
This is a shot from Stanford.
Just again for myself, is this thing?
This is being run under program control,
and it's putting that
that peg into that hole.
Well, I think so,
although it's there's not,
it's sort of vision.
It's not so clear exactly what's going on.
I I supposed to be, yeah,
how much it halts program control
and this is Stanford Tech.
(40:04)
I don't know very much about it.
Did you operate?
Well, well, the M farm was almost
entirely under program control.
It didn't have any interface that
that Minsky Bennett arm did have was
almost entirely under human control,
and we never really had a
program was able to do anything.
This thing plays around with the block world.
Yeah, it's it's not doing the
real what we call the block world,
but it is sort of stacking,
messing with blocks,
and it's not, it's it's, it's.
(40:36)
I don't think there's any vision
going on here. Goal this is.
Yeah, I don't know what it is I was doing.
That's that's something OK.
That's clip 6.
Whatever it is.
OK now if CLIP 7.
OK, now here we go.
Here's a here's a better shot of the PDP6
console area right at the start here.
(41:00)
So again, we see the teletypes.
There's a little bit different.
We've moved the furniture around it,
and in this picture and it it looks
like the three 40s on the other side.
OK and OK. Here's the MF arm.
Again you can see here that it it.
It had cylindrical coordinates.
It it had a a rotate.
It had a vertical and then it had
an extend and the extend worked
by having a hydraulic motor with a
square shaft and and and in this clip
you could see that turn in a moment
the way they they extend works they
extend comes out here and you see the.
(41:43)
The the there it is right there,
that square shaft that's connected
to a hydraulic motor and then that
is coupled to a gear which can slide
along as as it goes vertically,
and it's geared to the extend motion.
OK, now this this.
(42:01)
Person here is is Bill Gospar and
he was the primary programmer of
this thing and and of the.
And and and then,
here we have a picture of the.
The hand and this is the same hand
as we saw before, and and this hand.
Really,
one of the very best things about this.
We're going to see in some of
these clips is is this.
This calibrate thing that he did so.
(42:33)
As you see this hand it has a little
gnome and a little little piece
of metal with a triangle on it.
Now what we're seeing here now
is the video sector.
This this in this era we were probably
working with 16 K of 36 bit memory,
so there was no way that you could hold a
whole raster of of of data in the computer.
(43:00)
You know it's just completely impossible.
So in order to deal with that situation,
we made our own camera called a video
sector and this is a camera that had.
Random access deflection.
You'd say you know I XY.
You feed that out it it it
does magnetic deflection and.
And after a while you read back what the
intensity is at that particular point,
so that that's what this what
you see here in the first part of
this clip is the the little thing
kind of looks like a bug running
around on the screen right there.
(43:37)
That is actually the program reading
input from the video sector and and
sensing the light sort of tracking along
the lines of of the cubes and so forth.
Whatever lines it finds in the scene.
And then it it gets them together and says,
OK, well there must be a cube here and
and that's that's how it tracks the cube.
So it's.
(44:02)
River sector camera.
Because of memory shortage.
That's right,
was was was random access.
And.
And basically so here it is coming
down and picking up a block and and
and this one is is probably so when
we saw see those dots flying around,
yeah what's going on? Is that the?
The big screen around screen.
Is is well showing the program
running and we were looking at
not running around on that screen.
(44:34)
Well, we're looking at that.
That screen of course has been
programmed in order so that the
people looking at it can tell
what the program is doing right?
So it's purely an output device.
OK, but what's also going on is is
that the program is also reading
input from the video sector at
areas corresponding to to where
it's it's looking OK and and it's
using the random access.
Feature of the British veterans actually
running along the individual lines.
(45:04)
If it sees a what looks like a line,
uh in the screen it you know,
it's just steps right along that line
that OK, what am I looking at here?
OK, OK, what we're looking at here is
the M farm and hand the image itself.
I'm not looking at a screen no,
no no this is this is the arm.
Or no, this this is a a pictionary
that's been taken of of the setup.
(45:30)
As it's in operation.
So yeah, bye bye a movie camera,
yeah,
yeah, yeah,
that's independent of the computer
thing the computer is reading
in through the business sector.
OK, well this this this is picking it up
and it looks like it's it's probably just
picking up that cube that it just saw as.
Cool thing about this is the
sensitivity of the arm well.
Well, no, that's not what I'm saying.
(46:01)
Actually, the calibration is and we'll
see a better example of a calibration.
But anyway that that clip we just saw I
think is the first thing that we've seen
that represents actual hand eye coordination.
In other words,
we we saw that the arm doing something
and we saw the I doing something this this.
This was the first time where the the
I actually saw something and it get
all the transformations or whatever,
and it basically sent the arm
down and picked it up.
(46:33)
Since it's out there,
are y'all gonna be guessing time about this?
This particular error,
the first time example six kind of timeframe,
but again I'm not gonna.
I really shouldn't say
that that even that much.
OK, now here we go with this
minskey Bennett arm again.
And this is Bill Bennett himself right here.
Driving it,
and as you can see here,
he has a little gnome and he has
just a little pseudo arm made out of
pots that he's operates in his hand
and and the the hardware servers
are set up so as to drive the the
physical arm to wherever the pots
are so he's he's using that to
sort of wrap around himself here.
(47:21)
OK, so these these the controller
through the pots?
Yeah it's purely and here we see it.
In fact it is 4 sections
that's that's Bennett,
Bill, Bill Bennett, yeah.
(47:34)
And the arm has 8 degrees of freedom.
It has four sections.
Each section has 2 degrees of freedom
and and we can kind of see the linear
pots and the the linear hydraulic actuators.
In this picture.
At some extent.
And here he is just wrapping, wrapping it
around himself some more and so forth.
OK, now let's see what else we see here.
(48:02)
Here's a little more detail.
Damn, I'm fine, no no,
that's the Bennett arm.
It's a different, it's completely different.
It's not dominski or anything.
It's no, no, no.
It's the second or it's the
second one that's here.
They they were.
The two primary ones.
So all there may have been a few others have.
Mitski, Bennett, arm Minsky, Minsky,
Minsky designed it and Bennett
machined it and constructed it OK,
and that's better playing with it.
(48:31)
Yeah, and that's been playing with it and.
And then the other thing we see here
is is a shoulder in this picture.
It's actually the arm is
suspended from a shoulder,
and here's minskey playing with it.
OK, so next next picture is.
Is Minsky sort of doing the
same thing as Bennett was?
And it it the the shoulder was a
differential type of arrangement where
but unfortunately it was never able
to be used for anything because of the
fact we're unable to deal with the arm.
(49:10)
And from programmable point of. POV.
OK, so now let's see.
Now the next clip after Minskey.
Let's see what that is here.
It's going to start.
Yeah.
(49:32)
Yeah, it's almost 6:00 o'clock.
We could keep at this for a long while.
You know I come into MIT twice a week.
Tuesday and Friday pretty much every week,
and So what we're gonna have to do,
I think, is basically sort of get together
on Tuesdays and Fridays and and we can.
You don't mind, I will.
I may want to get somebody in a technician
mode or something like that to be
sure that we don't lose this stuff.
(50:03)
Yeah, perhaps get some transcription going,
so yeah. OK, and then then this.
This looks like Margaret Minsky here,
Professor Minsky daughter,
who was just a young girl at this time,
as she looks like she's 11 or 12 years old.
And she's she's playing with it there for
a moment. Are you in touch with Marvin?
Not so much in recent years. You know, I.
(50:33)
Just tell me because it might.
It might be interesting to get.
To tease him into a session,
sometimes with the Margaret
Minsky photograph,
in addition to all the
other stuff that's wrong.
Well. OK,
so here's more of Bennett playing with it.
And it has a, uh, some kind of a stick
hooked onto the end of it, which is just.
(51:01)
Or something,
or other means nothing for play.
And here they've got the cover on it.
So basically, like Lucy wasn't,
and that that looks like the end of it.
OK? And then the at the very end?
No, no, no.
We're back to the beginning.
So that's that.
That's it.
That's that's it, for that's #7 OK,
let's stop there.
Well,
I guess maybe we can get this first group.
8-9 let's see here.
(51:32)
OK, now #8 is a sound.
Picture and what this is is is logo.
These are turtles made with logo.
And we see here a turtle made out
of stepping motors and and it has a,
uh, a felt marker that it can
make things on and and this.
(52:03)
Kid is is programmed to to to to make a,
uh, a design here.
One of the famous design that they made
is called a squirrel and that one actually.
And it's made by a very very simple.
Per computer program.
And it's a good hack to this day it
represents a tragedy that the the kids
are not learning how to really program.
They just play games with
their computers and so forth.
But this is. Is it still logo
stuff going on with everybody?
Yes there is. It's it's almost,
you know it's going on a few places.
(52:39)
I'm not an expert in it.
You know there's people
over in the media lab.
It is still over there.
Well, he's.
He's sort of retired, I think,
but he may drop by occasionally.
But yeah,
of course Hal is in the in the building here.
Yeah yeah. And how and in these days
he was part of the logo group, right?
Now there's other people too.
(53:01)
I know you don't want to give me a year.
Yeah, I don't know it
was something like that.
Anyway, the these these turtle things could
be made either on the 3:40 or on the.
On a display or or with the physical turtle
and these displays were very expensive,
so that was a big problem was with
how to make a a display for the kids.
(53:36)
Control it's being controlled by the logo
language and and the the console being used.
Here is something called an executive port.
Drawing on the screen, yeah,
now you just put a pencil into what it?
Well there it is right there.
See, you see there's a turtle,
it's got two stepping motors and it's
got the pin and it's got a solinoid.
(54:00)
So computer itself is still
is just driving this device.
The turtle devices and output
device for the for the PDP.
Well, I'm not sure which this
this looks to me like.
This was possibly being driven
from the PDP six.
I actually I think it was in later years.
It was PDP 11 and then and
then different other things.
But here at the at beginning
here you see these consoles.
(54:34)
These things are called executive ports.
They cost $3600 or something like that.
They were thermoelectric.
They used a thermal paper,
so it was fairly expensive paper and
they worked at 30 characters per second,
which was much faster that the teletype was.
You know, basically 10 characters per second,
so this was three times as fast.
(55:01)
Printing printing rate.
And we had an electronic thing.
It was a serial,
like a teletype device,
so it it it it it.
It received his Texas writer.
That's right, that's that was
another acoustic coupling on the
box and they used thermal paper
and they used this whole great yeah.
Well this was a competitor
of that I think. And this.
(55:32)
This executive report was a little
bit earlier and then sort of.
Yeah, they lost out in in a
little bit to to Texas instrument.
As as years went by a little bit.
But it was very similar device three times,
fast, well, three times faster,
and the 3035 yeah.
And the other thing is that
we had an interface to it.
It's a serial device, so it can work
at at at a remote distant device.
(56:00)
You know over modems and stuff and.
We had a little logic so that via
computer controlled by by typing a
funny character or some odd thing, yeah.
You could basically twiddle the
signals connected with this with
these stepping motors and step
the stepping motors so so this.
Set up was usable in a physical school.
In other words,
we had our for a fairly short
interval and I think it's actually
during this time we we were actually
running in a school in Lexington
called the Muzzy School I believe,
or one of the one of those out there
and and basically you know at a
certain class hour the kids would
come on and and use our machine.
(56:52)
At that time we had a very.
Primitive timesharing system.
And and they could actually use this as
part of their school day and so forth.
(57:02)
Was that on daily basis or or?
Well, yeah, I don't know.
I think it might have been on daily
basis for just a very short time
like a couple of weeks or something.
But
yeah, and and and you had.
I think I think.
Well, they have three kids
who know what's going on.
I mean they they they well,
we had a logo sitting here and they're
they're giving teletype commands, yeah,
and there's there's illustrations of that.
(57:33)
There's this logo programming language,
you know which is designed so it
had a sort of a built-in editor,
and it had everything else you need.
But how is the?
How is the remote location in Lexington
getting feedback about what the output is?
Well, in those days it was a real opinion,
basically.
We had a multiplexer.
We had several arrangements and basically
during during some of that period we had
to make our own modem and multiplexer.
(58:07)
That would basically say
you know transport three
3300 CPS teletype signals out
there that's coming in and then
turning around and going back out.
No no, no. Same thing 300 CPS
characters stream and it's done printing
on this on this piece of paper.
(58:31)
Yeah, OK, so we called that
they're writing in this instance.
We've seen 2 instances
before of what the output is.
One is the screen, the other is drive.
A turtle is 1/3 output.
Now of drive the thermal print.
Well, you wanna look at it that way,
yeah, I mean actually there's the turtle
and the printer or the two things.
And then the the turtle can
either be a physical turtle which
runs around on the floor,
or it can be a a screen turn.
(59:00)
Yeah yeah.
And this particular film I think.
I'm not sure what display
this is shot off of it.
This looks to me like it might have been
the 3:40 these kids might have come into
to our lab for this particular thing.
So in this era,
I don't believe they did have a a display
capability in the school in the school.
However,
they wanted it very badly and and so as
a result of of them wanting it so bad.
(59:32)
Minsky and Papert actually made a
small company and is a very long
story to try to make a a device.
To do that and they they did succeed,
although it was the time that they
were so in the school that your
recollection and name of the schools,
the Muzzy School, that's one of them, yeah.
Time during the day the kids, yeah.
My one of these typing machine,
yeah executive port typing machine.
Well they they had.
(60:00)
They had three of them.
Yeah they they had you know 33.
You know kids can work in groups
of two for example and and you
and you have 3 consoles so that
is absolutely incredible.
They're out there in a school in 1968.
Device coming back in to run the PDP six
for the purpose of running a logo program.
Yeah,
and they're doing this in
their own class in their own
classroom situation collections.
Yeah,
that's right.
And let's see here, you know,
have you seen have you seen this story
written any place I told any place?
Well, yeah, actually there's that part
of the story is so tragic, I mean.
(60:46)
There may be reason why they don't
tell it too often is because the
this the you know this whole logo
thing was was flubbed and but but as
a historical fact this is as big a
game as the one that we all remember
and that is the the creation of the
mouse and all that stuff out at Xerox.
(61:08)
Doug
Engelbart, yeah yeah.
So I mean, this stuff is going on here
with the remoteness and so forth.
Well yeah, it's not as big, but it's well,
it's it could have been done right.
It would have been bigger, of course.
Anyway, that's another whole other story.
OK, anyway, that's that's what
that is and I you can get a couple
of glimpses here of of of the
surroundings and this this display,
and I'm not sure if this might
all black and white display.
(61:42)
I thought I saw color there.
It's a black and white display.
All these displays are black
and white in these area.
In this area they did have.
Multiple phosphor, you know the display.
That's right,
it was just like a radar screen.
(62:00)
So there's a short phosphor that's blue and
A and a long phosphor that is yellow green,
and that's that's another.
Yeah, and this I'm not sure if this is
a very this might possibly be safe.
An early game, well, it's hard to say.
OK, OK, that's let's clip 8.
OK, now we're good here.
Last one for today.
I think it's gonna be clip 9.
(62:33)
This one has sound.
OK, in this one Stanford so this
this one is there's nothing I
really know about. Let's see.
Yeah, as a matter of fact I if
that's all Stamford I should
pull that out of the collection.
Yeah, this one is definitely Stanford.
Yeah, and there there's I think
that's that arm that we saw
before and the other clip too.
(63:00)
So I think I think that confirms
that Stanford then there's.
And this is a polished thing.
I mean, it's not just random
clips, it's it was actually.
Alright, well here we go for.
Four one shot and.
And.
Yeah.
In case. On Tuesdays and Thursday,
Friday through Friday.
(63:37)
I'll give you my number to contact
information, so right now.
(contact details removed)
(64:01)
Yeah. OK, let me shut this off.
Let me see how do I stop it now stop it.

## 2006-05-30

(0:00)
This is the beginning of
another session describing film.
It's playing back movies,
playing back, that thing,
same thing that talk about the 2nd.
So let's get up to the end.
In our last session we got two
believe film identifiers #9.
With a better understanding of the tools,
I would just be able to skip
to the end, but OK, stop.
Recording test test test.
(0:31)
OK, yeah 10, here is a kind
of Seymour Papert. And.
There's some kids within executive port.
Now the exact report again was the
device she told me was that in 1968
or 69 that you were communicating
to the Lexington High schools.
Yeah well there was a multiplexer to do that,
but the executive court was a relatively
lightweight replacement for a teletype,
and there's 30 characters per second
instead of 10 characters percent.
(1:16)
$3500 or something used
Electro. Thermal paper.
(1:32)
And that box right there,
I think is is is the is the
interface that work with the serial
on they the serial line not only
drove the executive port but also
interface to the to the turtle.
And here we have a display this HP.
Display was a random access.
And relatively light for random
access display particular area.
(2:10)
Had very had some kind of a
magnification thing in it,
so it had very poor point size.
Spot size is sort of the focus
but but at least it was large
and it didn't weigh a ton.
Normal TV set. Let's see more.
(2:33)
First creation of world.
In early creation we both.
It's not just advanced.
Looks like this.
This whole film is just see more
with the students interact.
I'm ready at the end.
There's a shot of another
physical Turk with OK.
Let me know.
(3:03)
So keep me honest here in my comments,
Matt. So what's going on?
Is it very early days?
This is trying to reach to the 4th
grade kids and give them a programming
activity and the programming
activity that came out was being
able to control this turtle that
that was a drawing mechanism device
involved this programming language.
OK, now this.
(3:34)
This.
So this is number 11 #11 and I
don't recognize this, so this this
this is not our work in our lab.
Stanford or it almost looks
out might be a Japanese or.
Really cute little robot here that
has both the mobility and and an arm
and a gripper. And small in size.
(4:05)
OK.
OK, so we need to look elsewhere to find
out what's going on so it has at least.
And probably what you're saying is,
there's a good chance we need to
pull it out of the collection.
With somebody else's work.
And this and 12 also looks like it may be.
(4:35)
This is another one which is.
I guess it looks different.
Again, this is not something I recognize.
It's this is doing a tracking
of a line along the floor.
We did do some of that kind of thing, but.
With that kind of growth,
but as far as I remember, so number 12,
maybe somebody else is robot.
(5:02)
In particular, 12 seems to be the robots
can't claim to fame is that it's doing
a tracking of a line on the floor.
Yeah, we did that too.
That was an easy thing to do.
But OK, now here this is our robot.
This is the M farm and we saw before and
this is phone number 13 phone number 13
and I think this may be tower for now.
(5:31)
I'm not sure who this girl is.
It looks to me like this is
probably an open loop picking up.
We're just doing this
terrible noise type of thing.
OK now here we have chest which is my
programming and it might be Carl Angleman.
Anyway, it's we're looking
at the PDP6 console area.
The 3:40 is on the right,
the micro tapes or visible.
This is a shot from the the
screen and the free 40 display.
(6:04)
Talked about that and it just
looks like you're confusing just.
This is commonplace now where you
want to understand that this is like
the first time for all of this stuff.
Probably in 6768 years I would guess.
OK, now we're onto #14 and back here.
Back with the AMF arm. According to my.
(6:33)
Yeah, my fine is the early around.
Comes into play later.
Well now the two of them were
were were actually the same time
the animal farm, the Minsky,
and we built in machine from scratch.
Ourselves is Skype Bill Bennett.
The AM Farm was a industrial arm
from American Machine and foundry.
We we interfaced it. Now here.
Here's a good hack this.
This is a calibration and and
we can see where we're seeing.
(7:00)
Now is the grippers on this 340
screen and they're projected and.
And transform so.
You know that you can actually sort
of check check the the closed loop.
And what we're seeing here
there's this no man,
that's a little piece of metal
which is has sides on it.
For the grippers to grip.
It also had a magnet on it so that
it could be held a way that it
could essentially get it out of the
way and fetch it when it wanted.
(7:37)
And it the arm went to a number
of of reference positions.
The camera tracked the.
The triangle that was in the Noma.
And then by doing that the IT was
able to automatically generate a
calibration matrix and basically
transfer through all the coordinate
transfers and so forth.
(8:01)
That would involve.
So then when you when you start
writing code then you've got an
exact connection between the well,
you don't have the code is in general,
in other words, it's all of these things.
Of course had had lots of calibration
difficulties where what it did on one
day might be different on another day,
and so forth and so on.
So this is.
You know improved great improvement
in robustness,
OK?
And so this this film #14.
(8:32)
The traffic thing is going on there.
Is this calibration effort with
the right there, it's it's.
It's flipping it up onto the magnet
right above the hand there kind of
drooped over the top is is this thing
with a magnet and let's gospel.
He just took it manually there
so he apparently didn't succeed
in flipping and and and.
Transferring it to the magnet,
but it frequently did.
(9:03)
OK, so here we go again,
there's Cosper again.
Or he's demonstrating that it.
It gives to that it basically had a
sensor on the tips of the fingers,
and if you pushed it.
Push down those fingertips,
then then the arm would would
sort of give it.
It was not really true force feedback.
One of the problems with this
kind of arm is it was you know.
(9:30)
Although it's open loop it,
it has the full force of the arm against it.
Didn't really have very good
touch sensor or a way to sense.
Something pushing back on it in general,
however,
it did just do that just a little
bit with regard to using these
so it knows it's something.
If you push it hard enough,
but it's not well actually.
In most cases it would not know
that the only place that it was
sensitive to anything pushing on it
was these touch sensors right on
the fingers right on the fingertips
where where he was pushing.
(10:04)
I don't know exactly where to touch.
But the whole question of getting
force feedback into an arm is a
crucial question and and you know,
although we attempted to deal with it,
we never really.
Solve that problem properly and I don't
know if there's been solved to this day.
As far as I know, I don't know.
Anyway, I don't keep track of this stuff too.
OK, let's see here.
(10:31)
Here is more AMF farm.
Here it is finding cubes and
picking them up and stacking cubes.
Did you copy demo? This one?
Looks like it's just stacking.
It's not actually trying to copy.
Sorting, so it's it's picked
up all the cubes and it's
sorted them according to size.
OK, so that's that's #14.
(11:01)
OK, now now here we go
with 1515 is the Ernst.
So this is a new generation old,
much older generation, this this.
This was before I came to MIT by quite a bit.
There's a guy named Ernst who had
had made this arm for the TX Zero.
The TX Zero was a very early computer.
It was the first computer
was a transistor I CPU.
(11:31)
It was made at Lincoln Labs.
There was a quick shot of the
name plate as we went by there
there's a picture of the TX0.
So this was a very first
computer with a transistor I CPU.
It was in building 20.
Here's here's a picture of it.
And this this large panel to the left.
Here is the CPU that is a who built
at Lincoln Labs Lincoln Labs.
It it was originally called
the Memory Test Computer.
(12:00)
It was Lincoln Labs built a 64K core
memory which was the largest in the world.
And that was called the S memory.
The initial purpose of this computer was to
do nothing other than to test that memory OK.
Then after that phase they they they they.
Embellished it, added a few instructions.
One thing another I know you
don't want to throw dates,
but give me a rough date on this 155.
You have to look it up.
(12:30)
Things that can be checked.
Alan is quite that early.
No, I I think it is in the 50s so.
Is this the machine?
It's the beginning of?
The debt corporation? Is this the pre?
Well, in many ways it was.
I mean you have to get that story
from Ken Olson and those guys.
But but basically this is an 18
bit machine made at Lincoln Lab and
I'm sure there's another direction.
From what Univac and IBM and CDC
and all those guys are playing.
There's a smaller direction to apply it.
(13:02)
That's right, that's right,
and it's really a different direction.
Also from the TX two at Lincoln Lab
to follow when Lincoln Live got
around to making their real machine,
it was a 36 bit machine called TX 2.
OK anyway, what we see here
is this left double panel.
Large thing to this to that's the CPU.
That's the computer itself and
it had eight K of 18 bit memory.
(13:34)
This is the operating console
area here and CRT display point
plotting CRT similar PDP one.
To the left of that is a switch is
registered it had. 16 registers of.
16 bits per switch so you know you
could actually had 16 words in in
memory where you had to switch to
set every bit and you could just,
you know, toggle in a full program
of 16 words and transfer to it
and run and that was that. I did.
(14:08)
I actually did on much later thing I
did the original boot program load.
What's the address?
And then you know the address
panel line and then the instruction
writing and they hit the load button.
Getting started.
On this on these early computers
was a big deal because it it
required a lot of control.
Logic control logic was really expensive,
so they they they tended to.
(14:33)
Cut corners, so that's right.
In order to get the machine
started from a cold start.
Probably the best way was to.
Toggling I think I actually,
although I was around in here,
I never actually used it myself.
A lot.
Great play with that.
So anyway,
this next panel is switches here is it?
Switches and lights is is essentially
the console shows that the AC and
the kids are having index registered.
(15:01)
Then there's then off to the right here,
which we can barely see is the flux writer.
The main input for the machine
was paper tape.
And it had a fairly fast paper tape reader.
However,
for paper tape writing it,
it only used the paper tape punch
associated with the flex order,
so it's only 10 characters per second.
Paper tape punch and the TIXO also
used the very right at 30, right? No.
(15:39)
It's asynchronous, though it's it's not.
It's not a teletype thing where
it necessarily completes it.
It has a completion pulse type of thing,
and so you know carriage return.
For example, takes a long time.
Do you ever see any paper?
Have you ever seen a telephone machine?
Now this. It's the second panel
kind of in the middle here. Was.
(16:11)
This thing here was a tape drive and
it looks like it may have been this.
This picture was it was taken obviously
several years before I came on scene, but.
But anyway, then when she didn't have,
she was physically sitting.
Oh, it's it seems only 26 it was.
It was next door to the PDP one
on the 2nd floor of building 26.
(16:32)
Yeah, it it having been moved,
of course from Lincoln Lab after
Lincoln Lab people got through with it,
they gave it to MIT and and.
Anyway, the over here to the right
was a timing generator and this was
a a full 19 inch relay rack full
of vacuum tube delay lines and.
Is sitting here in a in a rest?
It was an oscilloscope,
a full oscilloscope,
full time dedicated to the machine
and on this oscilloscope was where
little dots painted on the screen.
(17:09)
You know where where the timing
pulses were supposed to be and
that is when you started it up.
Sometimes it wouldn't start
up right and so forth.
It was a button you could sort of push
and and extinguish the pulsing and get
started the way that they got softer.
You have a plot that you tune tune.
The thing is well.
Pushing that thing is the the
the way it worked was that they
they delay lines were hooked in
a circle so there was just one
pulse running around and around.
(17:38)
Define the cycle and occasionally
you might get either no pulses or
two pulses running in that circle,
in which case that's bad news.
You had to just push a button for a minute,
and that extinguishes it and then
push another button. Push back again,
maybe in the end it starts going. OK,
and then then this panel to the right again.
A floor to ceiling panel
with three relay racks.
(18:01)
That was a power supply and and the power
supplies were also largely vacuum tubes.
And had.
What kind of power they're putting up?
Well, I don't know that yeah,
I mean the the PDP one had.
Plus 10 and minus 15.
What were the primary primary supplies?
I don't know what they were on that Excel,
but probably so it's in that
range or something like that.
(18:30)
It was enough that if you shorted it with
a screwdriver or something it would.
It would notice, hey,
you'd notice and be it was dangerous.
It could fry a bunch of transistors.
OK, so there's the. So now this is.
This is a short, closer thinking
of the console and the display,
and there's the paper tape reader.
Here's the flexor writer.
(19:01)
And so the and here is
this arm that earns build.
He he did it by taking a remote manipulator.
They've been developed for.
You know you can see here in the
picture actually that there's a.
There's a slave in the back.
What this is normally.
Reactive stuff, so yeah,
right there you can see the the command.
Normally this this is just serve owed
and and it's a remote manipulator,
so this thing is fully functional
because they've they've got walls
where people are playing with radium.
(19:36)
So they built this on that's control
from the outside and it's got grabbed.
One of these arms and stick
it on the computer.
Yeah, angry interfaces it.
And there was a quick shot of his
with his rack full of logic to
interface and his name is Ernest and
he because he become a recognized
as a big name and he should have.
Then went back to Germany,
never heard him again and I never.
I never met the man.
I I I did see this.
(20:02)
This with this family could very well be.
You know, back in you know,
but even at that time you see it
been quite a few years. I mean,
when I was doing this this stuff here,
you know it was 6360 four 6566 kind
of thing and and then further on but
but I probably saw this tape sometime
in the neighborhood of 6667 maybe.
And you know at that point that it already
been eight years ago or something like that.
(20:35)
You know you can look up these
see exactly when its thesis was.
But this was very, very early work and it
was also very good in a lot of ways, yeah.
Just after I talked to you,
I heard Rod books talk the following
news of the visits and he's still there,
still chasing the arm problem.
Yeah, I said right.
I was just watching some film from
the 60s and they were doing the arm.
Then we have 40 years later
nothing is changing.
(21:00)
Why don't my hands are different?
They really have to play really.
So here's but but the point of this thing.
Some of the good things about was that it did
have a relatively sophisticated force sensor,
so that when it touched the ground it could
could feel that he also had a relatively
sophisticated programming environment for it,
which was a kind of a medium
level thing, and it it it?
It could sort of jump into unrelated code.
(21:32)
In other words,
in some of these demonstrations here.
It's trying to do one thing and you suddenly.
Sure, but you you come in and you
take the block away from it or
you hit it somewhere and it it it.
It has a thing there where it can sort
of just jump to an unrelated section of
the program which it hopes might go to.
What's not a completely free go to.
I mean, it's there's some smarts in the
sense that it's trying to go to a place
which will deal with they get back into into.
(22:04)
So sensor is sending a signal that is.
It pushed the block off well.
In some cases it if there was
no vision connected with this,
this this is entirely, I think,
kind of assembler language or
something that he's using.
Yes he had. He had a couple different
languages which you might talk
compiled yet compilers on, well,
it's a joke and it's special purpose.
(22:32)
So so it's.
But it it actually, it was pretty good.
He wrote a thesis and so that's the big deal.
Go look at the thesis and we'll find
the summary of this is the Ernst thesis
should be associated with film 50.
Yeah, in fact. And.
So let's see that and this is very,
very early work.
This is using the the Lincoln Lab.
(23:01)
Primitive computer, one of the
first computers oversight after
it comes to the MIT campus.
The first computer with a transistor I CPU?
Well, that's better.
And that's where the word bug comes from.
OK, so anyway, that's that's more of it,
and that's that's a good cry,
so there's probably this fall
most probably made in support of
his thesis. Say that control.
(23:35)
OK, so that's that's 15.
OK, so now go on to 60.
I wonder when I see something like this,
whether or not it's true.
What you said that this stuff is
still usable today? Oh wait man.
Some of the answers they tried then.
Well in some ways it is better
than anything I've seen today.
Now I haven't kept track of this inducing.
OK, now this is another thing,
and there's several of them here.
(24:02)
This this, the fellow that did
this is is is Mike Beeler and
he's still around he, he said.
He should be reachable to
the MIT Alumni Association.
I I got his phone number and I
haven't managed to reach him.
He was a close.
He was a roommate actually of
mine at one stage or several
years earlier than this.
Well, this he got ahold of some some solar
corona data through some contact he had.
(24:33)
I don't know the details of it and
basically this was basically just
displaying the sunspots and and other
features on the sun based on that data.
Well, and this this one is color
and of course see we didn't have.
Color on any of our displays in
those days that just make up.
However, there was one.
(25:01)
The deck had made two.
Yeah, that's his. February 15, 1970.
So so this one, yeah. Anyway, yeah,
yeah there was a deck had made.
Two color displays as an
experiment and these were.
Really humongous.
It was about as long as this whole desk here.
It had electronics in two bays
on either side and then in the
center it had a big shadowmask CRT.
(25:40)
Early television we've got
round screen thing.
Well, this one actually wasn't round.
Many of those CRT's in those days
were were this one was was the
CRT they'd been designed for.
Regular for early part television.
So so it it was sort of pseudo rectangle,
but it but it was a point plotting
display and and of course you
know there's enough problems
with convergence in in a.
(26:07)
You know you have three different.
Shut, unless you've got to come
at it from the right angle,
so you have to converge it.
You know so that they have the red,
the right and the green and
the blue all hit the same place
for the same nominal defects.
Deflection well with a with a
random point plotting thing.
And then the problems of
that are just multiplied.
So so basically that caused the effective
resolution to be very low and so,
but what what we're seeing here?
This guy goes off and he gets some film.
(26:39)
I mean, some data from somebody.
Yeah, and that that data is numerical data.
Some measurements have been made
scanning the sun and so forth,
and now what he's doing is he's
he's doing the first take at doing a
graphical display of numerical data.
And that's the plots that we look at.
That's right, that's right.
And and so I think I think.
This this was very likely taken
during this this color display
having been made it was it was so
low resolution there wasn't really
a used anyone and and and basically
it's it kind of sat around a deck.
(27:16)
One of them for for many years
and somebody said well,
let's get rid of this and give it to
MIT so at a fairly late stage this
this is 1970. We already had the K 810.
During his so this is the
successor to the PP. 6.
(27:35)
And we had the two computers set up
in the same computer room and and we
were phasing over from the six to the
10 and and that involved, you know,
by that time we were running the time
sharing system and this is all in text.
Cortex Square, right?
And we had to deal with the paging
thing the the user mode hardware
and essentially we made it a
serious modification to the guts
of the PDP tend to add the paging
box and while that was happening.
(28:11)
K10 was kind of out of Commission for
running time sharing for quite a while,
but we would use it for running this
color display and and and sort of games.
Kind of as a separate processor,
whereas the main load was on the
Piedmont PDP 6. So for the multi.
(28:34)
No, not yet, no.
Our thing was a PDP6 and P-10.
Now the multiple people were
at the other end of the floor
and and they had a succession
of machines, a whole separate.
OK, so anyway, that's that's a solar
thing displayed on the color display.
OK, so you guys are the ITS people?
Yeah? And then the CTSS people,
well was much earlier, yeah?
And then. Like that that's right.
(29:06)
CCTS followed Multics,
follow following CTSS and I TS.
Is still unique.
OK, so now we're going here into 17. And.
So the only one that needs real
splitting so far is tape one as I recall.
Maybe it maybe some others that
had pieces buried. Now this is a.
(29:37)
This is another color display here and.
5 minutes. I'm also wave.
It's sort of displaying the surface
and the surface is kind of waving
around and the color is changing.
We don't know why I think
it just intended to.
Trying to give an idea of how
you could use color to do so.
(30:04)
OK here is is the big turtle.
This was the original turtle.
How big is it?
Well, it's almost almost equipment happened,
diameter in about 2 feet high or so.
And it has stepping motors and belts around,
and this was used with the kids.
And.
(30:31)
It's something that the kids can see,
so it was fairly popular,
even though it was very early and it
was kind of primitive in some ways.
The kids kind of liked it,
so they continued to use it.
They they we had a number
of other turtles too,
which is so much more in this display,
and that's how is it being controlled.
Why is coming in?
Absolutely, they're wired,
and this this doesn't show
how it was control.
I mean, it could be local
in the computer room,
it could be at a school.
(31:06)
But when they when somebody
is playing with that role,
they're sitting in a keyboard and
they're going right left circle.
Well, no, the the.
They're in the operational configuration,
which you know we don't know for
sure whether that was or not,
but I think it probably was.
I mean, they they have a tunnel type
or one of these executive ports.
(31:30)
They they have the logo
probing at Gramming language,
logo, programming languages,
commands like four week,
10, you know right 90.
So I said, yeah, OK.
OK, and then here's the number
of these things that kids
on bongo boards and I.
It's really not too much.
Like that was this this this idea of
balancing was was a thing and and that that
did have some serious things that people
for a number of years worked on on the on.
(32:01)
The idea of balancing a stick and and
reading programs to do that and so forth.
And it's still hot.
It's still a hard problem.
All these Japanese robots.
They're able to walk on a flat
surface will fall over very easily.
But anyway, yeah.
Problem involved in balancing a stick
was sort of a classical problem.
It's not too hard,
but was eventually done, but.
It was worked on by number of people,
different situations and
this is phone number 19.
(32:31)
Yeah, this is film number 19.
This is the AMF AR.
This looks like it might be an open
open cube stacking. I know it's a lot.
That's basically what it is.
Proceed onto to the 20s.
(33:01)
Free.
So in 20 is also a farm. Tubestock
again, I don't see any evidence of
any vision going on here, so I think I
think this is just open loop stacking.
(33:39)
What you mean when you say
open well some of these?
These ones are our vision.
You know where it's actually seeing the
the cube and and figuring out where it
is and doing all the transformations
and going down and picking it up right?
So you gotta censor up here.
That's a light thing and then you got the
hand down here and that's a closed loop.
(34:00)
So now we open loop who's doing the movie.
The. The robot is just moving.
You know, putting things back where
I put them before and so forth.
It's not not actually seeing anything,
it's doing OK or or even
no vision component to it.
OK, so you've done that coordinate
normalization activity before and the robot.
Now the program has this understanding.
Physical spaces and remembers.
I put this on.
(34:31)
I like your outline with your blind and with
no touch sensor either really any any memory.
I put block.
That's sort of before the thing starts.
It would probably go down close and they
would feed it to block or do something.
You know that that's.
OK, now this this is Cynthia Solomon,
who's briefly on this.
And she was seen.
Collaborator had previously been.
She went back to school at one point,
she was Marvin Minsky,
secretary, and she she was,
and she had been involved in
logo for quite a few years.
(35:10)
Quite a difference in this situation.
So OK, so now we moved on to #2222.
This is the big turtle.
Drawing something.
This is a. Squirrel polygenism music.
And that's what Seymour Copper was
talking about. In that other clip.
(35:34)
A very popular thing for the kids.
Very easy for the kids to draw.
Yeah, and here is some stuff
for relatively short time.
We ran this logo thing on the PDP 6 and
and until they logo group eventually
got their own PDP 11 I started
something like what they call it.
Promise this these are this
this is this is a a worm,
which means that it's it has a head
and it kind of goes somewhere and
then it leaves a trail behind a trail.
(36:09)
On the screen.
Through the program and the
program has to refresh it.
There's another popular program
that you can write in local,
particularly when it was on the 3:40.
It's so yeah, there's several different.
So. Beginning here, we have a short.
(36:35)
File directory showing the very
short filenames. The filenames
have two six character names.
Very likely that was a directory of
a micro tape micro tape, you know,
held the 64 K of 36 bit words and
the directory structure held about
45 miles or so that you could
put on one micro tape you know.
(37:00)
Which is the stuff that I
always call dictate?
That's right, it's original name was
micro tape and due to a copyright issue
they they changed his name to duct tape.
I I usually call it micro typing.
Same stop, same stuff.
OK, now we're at 24 now.
This one is a little bit interesting.
This one I I called up gospar
after let me see couple of these
things and he asked me did did did?
Did I see something with all the
circles and I said yeah I did and
so here it is this this and I
think this may be specially circle
I don't know too much about the
details of it this this next thing
is definitely special nurse thing.
(37:47)
Personal.
ECINER he's also reachable through
the MIT Alumni Association.
And he's also local.
I actually did call him and talk
to him briefly and just let him
know that these in the first guy,
the other guy mentioned you
said glossary called Gospar told
him and and another third one
is Bueller Bueller. I I.
(38:13)
Don't rush me.
And Beeler, I have his phone number,
but I haven't responded.
We haven't succeeded.
Anyway, This Is Us gas simulation,
which we have several clips
of it in various cities.
(38:31)
And then here at the end, I'm not sure,
just looks like some room.
I'm not sure exactly what that is,
something that display up overnight.
And now here goes into color
when it goes to color,
then it's then it's on that color display.
The color display had such low
resolution that it could hardly
display characters at all,
so it was used mostly for
display hacks and it also had
this miss convergence problem.
So it it really was not
primarily useful for anything,
it was just for making pretty pictures.
(39:03)
It could make pretty pictures.
OK, here we're looking over
the phone number 2525 and
this is Model 35 teletype.
This is a logo and so they print
quote in English should do that.
This is mostly the others.
This is typing in one hole.
(39:30)
Program and then type in a Little
Display, Act another little pro.
Now now we have this circle thing again,
which. Interesting,
that should be on the same tape.
I don't know and now we
have the color thing again.
OK, so the the particular
juxtaposition of those on on the
tape is somewhat interesting.
I don't have any particular.
What did. Why did God ask if you'd
seen any of the circle stuff?
Well, he did, I don't know.
I just you know that that that that yeah
here we had some old tapes from PDP
six days and I gave them the URL and.
(40:08)
He said he was gonna maybe take a look.
Take a look, OK?
OK, so here we are at #25 and
this is also a big turtle.
And.
Some stuff. And then here's
another turtle. This is a somewhat
more plexiglass turtle with.
(40:40)
Also with stepping motors and.
Not so big and kind of a little more
modern in the sense less overhead.
It just has the stepping rotational anyway.
That's that's also great physical turtle.
OK, so that's 2025.
(41:01)
I'm 60 now. 26 is shared.
So that's one.
Major major thesis.
That's right, this is Terry Winograd,
and basically this.
Well, the English language
component was Terry Winograd.
But also Sussman and Czarniak
had major contributions,
so the three of them worked together.
I guess all three of their PhD
thesis were involved in this,
although some sense we really
want to pull together,
these sure do pieces of of clip into
a single thing and then have it
linked into the feces on the three.
(41:41)
Anyway, what you can see here is
that it has a rather sophisticated
English language than where it can.
You can say things to it,
it has a semantic database.
Wearing it,
it views this picture of the blocks
world and can accept commands
and notice things about it.
And these blocks have colors and the
summer pyramids and summer cubes and
summers a box and they put things
in the box or do this and that.
(42:08)
It also has a simulation.
It did not ever really interface
to to the physical.
Are mobile people try to do that
a little bit but but it was.
It was.
The program was so big and
together with the arm thing.
Problem of getting those two linked together
at the same time was probably difficult.
But it did have a simulation, which is
what we see here now in the 3:40 and.
(42:33)
It is this thing descending
here is is just a very.
Rough stimulation of the arm,
but but it,
but as you give it commands it will actually,
you know,
kind of reach down latch on to something,
pick it up and move it down
and send it on something else.
But they never sold that,
so it works in virtual space,
but they never actually got
it to play in physical.
Well, it could.
(43:00)
I mean, it's it's essentially
trivial to do that, but they were.
It was technical obstacles
because it was a big program,
and in Lisp and got this thing
was a machine language and and
just just the problem of getting
the two of them running together
and and communicating was was
more trouble than it was worth.
OK, but here it is here haven't
given any command here it is picking
up a blog and putting it down.
Simulates that.
(43:32)
Now when I grab the big deal is that
he's doing this in the English language.
Well, there's there's a
number of that's right.
I mean, this has a.
English language component.
So it has a language component.
It has a linguistic component.
Rather, I should say and and then
it had the implementation involved.
This thing called micro
Planner which is a famous.
Sussman and Czarniak together did it,
and exactly what the division of
Labor is between the two of them.
(44:02)
I don't know,
but micro planner is not taking
these words then and taking a
command like move the block,
yeah, and then breaking up well.
Micro Planner was a thing
involved backtracking,
so essentially what it is is as a solution.
You know, sort of problem solving solution.
In micro planning you could write a program.
The program would go off and try and
do something if it if it reached a
certain thing it it had a provision to
say OK stop you, you do not win a fail.
(44:38)
It could then.
Go back to the last point.
It made a choice,
undo everything,
get back to that point and then
then proceed along a different
path so it was non deterministic.
In that sense you could get to a program
and there's multiple ways forward.
It would try one that failed,
then then then,
then backtrack and go to the others.
(45:06)
It's a big deal.
I have a strategy and.
The thing is,
it works pretty well.
I mean it was.
Aside from just the backtracking of it,
it had a database and had a number
of other things that I was like
micro planner, and this is certainly.
Recollection was session was definitely
a major play with that program.
(45:31)
OK, now we're 27.
OK, and this is the. Music.
We had had music on the deck
computers for many years.
A guy named Peter Samson who was
a mile railroad guy and so forth.
Originally did a music
system for the PDP one.
And it was based on what was called
the program flags there were.
(46:02)
There were these lights that that on the
PDP one that were just could be tested by,
you know skip on program flag one
or skip program Flag 10 and it
also where we're on the console
and it was a physical light bolt
that you could see on the console.
You could could be set up to the
program to do whatever it wanted
and so the the interface simply
consisted of of connecting.
The light drivers that were driving
these lights on the console through
a capacitor to to a mixer and
an audio amplifier.
(46:37)
So it was purely a square wave kind of
thing and the the computer was making
music simply by toggling that at an
audio rate and the PDP one was fast enough.
It could do it for sort of three
parts more or less before.
The sample rate became too
low and you got aliasing.
It's beginning to sound bad
when we got the PDP six,
we just updated the the the same program
and and it's P6 being faster and so
forth we were able to do 6 parts.
(47:16)
And this is a recognizable song.
Yeah, so you gotta score someplace.
Or Oh yeah, this is this is typed
in from sheet music in many cases,
and there was a compiler called.
It wasn't really very much a compiler,
but I did reformat things and and
basically do a certain amount of.
(47:36)
Now this is all pre Moog synthesizer
and all that kind of stuff right?
This is just the original notion
of taking well switch switch.
This is
1969. Yeah, see this.
This is this is quite old.
We'd had music much earlier than.
So, so that's right,
this this is probably not moose incisor,
but but but the original PDP1 music I
think may make might very well have been.
(48:06)
Again, you have to work out.
Look at the exact dates, but.
But basically that was already
going when I got to MIT in 62,
so Sampson actually hacked that.
Sometime 62 or earlier.
I got you on my team for 62.
So original computer science had an
artistic connection to it right away.
It's only later if there were
a few other computerized music
things that that that existed in
those days that were pretty funny.
(48:37)
The one thing that was not done by us
but was just as something at the time
there was something called a 650 change.
You know, the IBM big IBM computer centers
had had the machine called a 1401,
which was.
Peripheral processing to the 79 well,
those those machines had
a high speed printer,
but they change and somebody at
IBM generated a music thing that
that basically had to do with,
with striking printing things
on that thing at the right time,
and so forth.
(49:11)
And for for marching kind of thing
for percussive kind of thing.
It actually sounded pretty good.
It's pretty interesting sound to it.
But you know,
so there were just a few things that
they held up creating that chain.
For the Arabic,
Farsi and so forth languages for so
long because they wanted to just
create one change for that entire region.
(49:36)
So in the same way that the
change that they had for the for
the European had the unlocks and
the other pieces in the chain.
So they just manufacture, want change.
They wanted to play the same game with
that region of the of that kind of alphabet.
So they talked about it
for 10 years or something.
By the time they finally saw
that we moved on to Doc.
You know the whole thing,
we can't move.
Yeah,
the chain was really printer of
those days was really quite a piece
of logic and that she really went
around pretty fast and and the thing
skipped when it went to form feed one page.
(50:12)
It really moved fast with 75
inches per second or something so.
So occasionally when it when
it would shoot too much,
it it it would eat.
Florist.
Operationally, down at the Houston
Spacecraft Center they had several of
these 14 oh ones lined up and people would
come in and get output on huge sheets
of these these huge sheets of paper.
(50:38)
This thing worked on.
They came in with two wheels and
pick up a stack of output that which
I thought was immoral. Well, yeah.
When it was printing it,
it was only 600 lines per minute,
which in those days was a lot.
But that's I mean it's it's
it's 10 lines per second,
so it's going pretty good,
but it's but it you know the
paper is moving kind of slow.
(51:01)
But then when it gets to the the you
know the page object to move to the
top of the next page and it's not,
it's in the middle of the
previous page or something.
You know it goes shoot,
you know it.
Really it doesn't waste anytime moving
that page at all to get to the next thing.
So that's the only way to get information.
Well, a couple of people in external
laboratories are good screen,
but the world at large.
The only thing you're getting is
you're getting these things in the
world of business and so forth is
all running with these huge reports,
and that's it.
(51:30)
Biggest thing on a blog.
OK, and and this is again we're
now looking at take 28 and this
again is logo on the on the 35
teletype so just demonstrating that.
And more logo and then and then.
This is a short thing of 340.
Again it looks like a lot of this
stuff was from the year that we,
which was fairly short when we were
running logo on the and then here's
a circle thing circle come back.
(52:00)
We need to know there's a spiral thing yeah?
And let's see now this this one
doesn't look like it's color they.
Put together and there's.
OK, well anyway clips have
assembled for who knows what reason.
Yeah, OK, now we go to 29 and
again it's a solar corona.
This one actually has a title.
It says. Do you know whether
or not the people who?
If you look at that carefully,
you may be able to see what that is and.
(52:37)
We've actually did give attempts to give
a credit, and so the astrophysicists
were getting turned on by this stuff.
Well dealer had a contact and and you know,
I do too much about it.
But yeah, I mean, I think.
More so specialists.
This was better visualization than
anything they had at the time, I think.
And this is going on.
(53:00)
This is big stuff around the NASA because
at 69 when you get the landing and then
we find out about solar storms and that
becomes a big problem with man spaceflight.
Because if you got a solar storm coming
out of there out of the sun right,
you can kill all those people.
Sure yeah.
So this this kind of physics became very,
very important.
It's real fast, however,
I I think that contact was at Harvard.
I don't believe that
there was a NASA did have.
(53:30)
Installation,
you know at one point there was a
political decision made to have a
NASA installation here in Cambridge.
NASA was in the third building at
Tech Square and there's a bunch
of stories connected with that.
Then.
Then after a while they they built there.
They moved out of there and they
built their present transportation
building right and then at some point.
Somebody said it was ridiculous to
have a little group of NASA there,
so they turned it into the Department
of Transportation and it was there
was two people at major political
forces at play it on that one.
(54:05)
First of all, of course, Johnson.
When when the county probably trying to
push heavy stuff into the Boston area,
Johnson wanted to go to Texas.
And then when Nixon took over
then he didn't want anything to
do with Massachusetts.
So that was one of became transportation
and Volpi, I think eventually became. And.
Republican Governor of Massachusetts.
(54:30)
OK,
well here we here we have some
more stuff off the 3:40 it starts
with this special news gas thing
again and then some more circle.
OK so now that gas thing again
is the model of a.
Basically it's basically
a physical basic gas.
2 menschel physical simulation
of of circles and when they hit
they they deflect properly.
You know they they obey the law so it
looks like a gas or two dimensional.
Yeah well I'm not sure about
that you actually. Approximation.
(55:02)
But the main thing is is the
direction of the deflection.
So yeah, I think I guess right?
Yeah, I guess it's safe.
But anyway, I think that this this
this circle thing is also specialist.
I think that's probably also specialist.
This this is a contour thing and.
I, I think this this we had
a earlier clip of this guy.
I think it's salt.
I'm not sure if that's his proper
name or who it is, and that's
that's that's the name comes up on.
(55:33)
It wasn't a close social minded.
OK, so now we are on 31. And again,
we're looking at a 35 teletype.
Typing in a logo procedure.
And.
You got a pretty bad ribbon.
Of course in those days.
Any kind of a console thing
was dependent upon the ribbon
you had to change the ribbon,
the ribbon and it was full
hassle connected with it.
(56:08)
There there is some more 340 display.
I think it looks like and and
the turtle and little man there.
So this again is mislabeled.
That's being called a robot, but it's not.
It's really the church.
Well, it's mostly turtle squirrel.
And then there's a fairly interesting.
(56:30)
OK, so now we're ready for
32 like that somebody.
Stand it up.
This is this guy.
2.
Let's see.
Blocked.
OK, just a block down here.
It doesn't show very much about it now.
I believe that this thing
was was a. That was not
instead this. This thing guy
named Engelmann did OK 33 this
is cube 33 OK and here we are OK
here we are picking the Norman.
(57:20)
OK there you can see where
the Norman is on the magnetic
thing we aren't reaches up,
pulls it off and if it drops it.
Stop the film. They stop the film
and reload the thing up there.
(57:34)
Shooting again now. Gave up
pick up that.
That or is it? Yeah.
But it does not have a good force
control there, but really it it.
It just has electric motors.
It's not too strong there,
they're stepping motor,
but it's not cheating with
a magnet or anything, no.
(58:04)
Is that, is that normal?
OK, now. This this is the lights of
the processor. Now the PDP6 processor.
And then. We had 219 inch relay
racks to the right of the machine
to the left of the of the console,
which were the guts of the processor
and at the top of each one of those
there was a a panel of indicators that
basically enables you to look at the
internal state of the machine and if
you were debugging it and so forth,
you could sometimes but the layout
it looks like you got a four and
then a space and then the two.
(58:44)
The what was the paper tape player.
Alright, let's see.
Is this screen laid out the same way as no?
No, this isn't the operator console if
I'm sitting here at the operator console.
Typically, yeah,
I I would normally sit at a 90
degree angle to the console.
(59:00)
I would be sitting.
I'd have my model 35 teletype setup here.
Then at about a 45 degree angle
to that was a 340 display and the
tube there and then in front of me,
the operator console.
There was the the lights and the actual
operator switches which consisted of.
Of long finger stretches,
he's really nice buttons that you
can operate to start the machine
and stop part of the PDP great
this is this is high class.
(59:33)
This is this is great.
Yeah,
I'm more of them and so forth
because it's much more expensive
machine and basically that the
the registers that the programmer
would would be of interest in,
such as the program counter and
the priority interrupt lights and
the run light and so forth like
that we're on on that thing then.
Then the next panel over had the
paper tape and and above that in
the in the right hand processor
day was the the marginal test that.
(60:08)
There was a variable power supply
and the system where you could
test the machine by varying the
voltages and try to isolate marginal
components and so forth.
And the variable supplying the big
meter for that was located above
the operator position non normal
and then to the left opposite that
was the high speed paper tape punch
which which could be pulled out
and in order to to reload the paper
tape or empty the chat box and and
so it's it's slid back in and then
there wasn't an empty panel where
where the microchips were mounted
typically and then below that was.
(60:50)
The.
There was a whole 36 bit word of
lights which which were there was
a set of address switches.
(61:01)
On the console 18 machine had an 18
bit address, so their 18 address,
which is whenever the machine
referenced the the address set
in those switches it would load
that switch and into the light.
So you could set up a location.
And then then you could monitor in the
lights with that location was actually doing.
You could also load those
lights under program control.
If you just did day to zero.
It also loaded those lights so
so those lights could be used.
(61:31)
For example playing driving the music thing,
but it's just that's just a 36 bulb line
of lights and each one of them corresponds
to a bit inside a particular address.
Well, each one of them is just a
light and and and if you set up the
address which is to be an address.
Then anytime that address
thing gets modified,
it's going to load those lights as well,
so hopefully things will stay In Sync.
Yeah and then then below those 36 lights
was 36 which is we just called the
native word and the PDP 6 again had this.
(62:06)
This problem with getting started?
I mean you know,
in order to really boost the machine,
yeah it would required a lot of
logic so so they they did a shortcut.
It's actually a fairly funny shortcut.
The machine had these 16 fast registers.
One of the big features of machines was
that in addition to having core memory,
it had 16 registers made
out of explicit flip flops.
(62:33)
It was a 19 inch rack all full and they
had an access time of 400 nanoseconds,
which was substantially faster
than core memory.
Core memory of that era was
1.8 microseconds or something,
maybe 1.6. So.
Therefore, that left 16
registers in the core memory.
That was what we called
shadow memory that was safe.
(63:02)
You reference those things,
you got the accumulator system that
there was another feature of the
PDP6 which turned out to be a bad
feature in the later versions of it,
but they're initial idea was that
you could actually speed up your
program by by taking little loops and
moving them into the accumulator's,
and so they would run faster
out of the accumulator.
So anyway, there were 16
registers of core behind that.
(63:30)
Well, what you did was you put in a A
paper tape loader in those 16 registers.
And then it then to get to get
the machine started from the core,
of course, was nonvolatile.
You turn off power and it
would retain its information.
So you turn the turn the
machine on cold start,
and there was a way to disable the fast
accumulator's and allow those shadow
memories so called to show through.
And then you would hit start and
there would be a tiny program in there
that were reading the paper tape.
(64:02)
Well, occasionally that would
get wiped out and.
And when that happened then then that church.
You would have to actually key in and
and the people of deck actually did that.
They had to key in about 8 or 10 words
of 36 foot boards with with the keys.
You know.
Just take,
take a good 5-6 minutes of
blocks I've got I've got.
It was like 14 instructions.
(64:31)
And so we had one, however, that that.
That used to repeat things on the console
to repeat function and so anyway.
You could put just one and there
was also an execute button.
There was a you could move a button
and it would execute the contents of
the test where it is an instruction.
So so you put the condo paper
tape readers 60 and execute.
(65:01)
That would start the paper tape reader
read the 1st frame and then data I.
Yeah, you just had to switch a few bits.
You didn't have to really put in
a whole different instruction,
and then you put down,
stop and continue and repeat and it
would go chunk chunk chunk chunk chunk
it would read in enough paper tape.
To get started,
once it got to that thing you could lift
up by moving on the phone and so forth.
(65:31)
So, so you only had to type in 2 words.
OK, so OK, we're on 33.
And Oh yeah, OK, that's what
33 is toward the end of 33.
We have this shot and it's dark,
and you're just seeing the
the processor status lights
they just panned across there.
No logical meaning except if the
machine is down and they're trying to,
you know, determine where
they lost the time pulse,
or you know some figure out
what's going on in there.
(66:08)
OK, now this is the eye tracking.
We had a number of early eye
tracking things and this is
a really device. It's a game.
Where using the I track as a.
As an input device and and
essentially there's two.
(66:30)
Devices here we see two
little diamond shaped things.
One of them is operating under
control of the eye tracking and
the other one is operating under
control of a joystick or something.
And there's a ball and
the ball can be shoved.
You see, as you move the the
diamonds close to the ball.
You can sort of push the ball,
so this is a competitive game.
One side tries to to push the ball into
the either the left or the right side.
(67:00)
The other player tries to
push the volume at the top of
the bottom and this footage.
It's.
And so this is sort of illustrating
what a good question mark input devices
I tracker is that you can just look
at where you want this thing to go
and live tackle will track your eyes
and the thing will send it there
and and you can push this so the
eye tracker is watching your eyes.
(67:34)
We are moving now.
You're controlling just by going yeah
we had several flavors by tracking.
Minsky was interested in my tracking
and so we had several different
things over the years.
I think this one was right about
it was a hardware I think based
on on the infrared or something.
I think it shined and infrared
thing into your eyes.
Somewhat worried about frying
their eyes nobody, but it would.
(68:03)
Uh.
But anyway, that was.
I was right with the interesting
because one of the big things that
happened in terms of the understanding
of infants was when they get that
detailed eye tracking device was
they were able to show the new bonds
or able to recognize faces and that
blew away the whole notion of the
child as a clean slate at birth.
(68:33)
OK, now this looks like I think that
this is this is a mathematical thing.
I'm a 35 or security 5 and.
From this thing, I can't tell whether
it's maxima or or engelmann's math lab,
but just because of the other things,
I think it may be math lab.
The maximum system, did you know
work on this on this, you know this?
They got their own machine at a fairly
early stage, but but there was a time.
(69:00)
Of course when they didn't have a machine,
so the maximum machine that I
was familiar with was a PDP ten.
Well, that's right.
We we got kaitens in late 60s and there
were three of them on the 9th floor there.
That AI lab had one maximum
group had one and the the dynamic
modelling group under look like one.
But this is this is the AI machine because.
Warning display we're seeing here.
(69:31)
OK, we see refreshing so taking 35 we're
looking at either a running version of
maxima or a running version of math Lab,
both running in the same laboratory.
Well, they were somewhat
competitive projects.
This guy, Carl angleman.
Associated with Mitre,
which is my Theresa government consulting
output and so on and and originally MIT but
eventually became a separate corporation.
(70:02)
Yeah, and it already.
That was pretty early.
Actually it became simple preparation,
so I separated that time,
but it was still sort of family,
so whenever he was around.
So anyway, I think that that's what it was.
His he attempted to do some stuff.
OK now here is this wire for us.
This is on the color display on the 36.
Yeah, this this is one of the
things that kind of displays that
you could do on this color display,
which it was good for us is basically
making a fireworks display,
and so it's so again the world at
this time is still playing completely
in print on paper and MIT labs.
(70:39)
I'm beginning to develop this
whole business of well I guess
in some way actually.
Maybe this this color display as I
described was was given to MIT as
a hand me down six or eight years
after it had been built it from deck
deck deck had built these two things
in the early PDP one days but deck
at that time was all MIT people.
(71:08)
They roll out the door they roll
into into deck right?
No. Well, I mean I, there's a lot,
but I wouldn't, you know it was.
It was, you know,
those are close connection, but it wasn't.
Well, it was a separate company too.
I mean, it was it wasn't
a very close connection.
Pretty close I would say.
Well, it was close enough that they
gave MIT their number 3 PDP one
for example and then and then us.
(71:38)
They got the first one, it was number 3.
It was actually the first one and then there
was one given to BBN ever sold to BBN.
In this ours was actually the first one
that was in the final configuration.
If you look at the pictures of the PDP one,
the blue thing with the with dancing
the MIT was the first of those, the.
(72:03)
Two earlier ones were sort of a
desktop configuration that would
look completely different,
but it was the same machine,
but maybe three became the actual
production format of the action.
But anyway, after like fireworks,
yeah, that's what this is.
This is fireworks on the color display.
But anyway, you get to the question
of what you're displaying out.
I I think we were able to make a little bit.
(72:30)
You see, this had being several
years later and and this business
about the PDP 10 but we had a K
810 driving this color display.
Very likely at this time so that was a
much faster machine that was, you know,
five microseconds per instruction.
Average and mean that it was made
by using flip chips and it had
it had an integrated circuit.
The fast accumulator's of the of the
PDP six of P10K10 were were 16 bits per
per per chip and so you know instead of
being a 19 inch relay rack that they.
(73:13)
Fast accumulator's were about 6 inches
or so of a of a flip chip plug in,
so you know this. Again, the serious.
Beginnings of integration.
The very beginnings of integration
as far as tech is concerned,
all the logic was still discrete transistors,
but it was sort of a second generation
discrete transistor called Flip Flop
opposed to the first generation.
(73:41)
Discrete transistor called system modules.
The system modules where they
know decade in the very original
days was a module company.
They weren't even the computer company
they went into business making these
modules so that had a a particular
mechanical format and connector and
everything called system modules
and it kind of a a generalization
of that was used for the pieces.
(74:04)
Anyway, getting back to this point here.
In the days of the PDP one,
I don't know what they did with it.
I mean I was at deck and you know
whatever customers they had but but
with the PDP one they had even less
opportunity to do anything interesting
with this color display because
not only was it incredibly slow,
but they all got incredibly
slow machines and so forth.
We at least had a relatively faster cycles
to be able to play with sprinkles and it
was it was completely dependent on that.
(74:34)
In order to even just play
a little bit of stuff.
Even so, it was really just good for.
My pictures, but I'm going to.
OK, we are now in 37.
OK, this says ETL robot and this looks like
this is not ours so we might be able to.
Well, it's a post thing, it's not.
It's not the same thing we've seen before.
It's it's an arm.
(75:00)
It's on a post.
It's not ours.
He has a group in Switzerland, so.
But I don't know if it may have.
Pasta is also possible.
Something to do with. Anyway,
yeah, this this is stuff which.
So let's see.
Patient polyhedrons using range?
Oh yeah, and it's oh he T
also has a thing in Japan.
(75:36)
Yeah, so this is.
Here's some Japanese writing,
so this this is your phone.
This is so we want to either lose
want to label. It definitely is.
A farmer is not MIT film, right?
Alright, so that's 37.
And have TTL for this still around
right? They get their phone.
(76:07)
There's a few people that were
here and then and and went back to
there and maybe now this is also
something I'm pretty sure this is.
Stanford might be Sri,
but this is a number 38 and
assembly task where there is
some kind of a generator and.
Robot Assembly of automobile.
I think this may be Sri where they hit.
(76:31)
Working with.
Automobile manufacturers.
Appendix sponsor oh oh,
this is Charles Stark Draper.
This is a Draper.
Keep going. Well,
actually I that's right now.
Draper Lab was active in some of these areas.
However, they had a secrecy thing.
So that's right, there was practically no.
So this is unusual.
(77:02)
'cause I thought they had just
everything was classified.
The lab was closed.
Well, pretty Healy.
I mean, you could get.
It so happened that they had in
those days you had something called
freshman elected and that was you know,
everybody took the same course.
Anyway, I took the fight guidance
seminar with Charles Stark Draper.
You know, he was just one.
And basically we had to go through
a thing where we we got secret
clearances and once we were able to
get sequence clearances underwater.
(77:35)
And that was basically what we did as.
Do you recognize these people?
No, you can't. You just try to play it.
There's a famous story tell about
the guy who was in the 60s when
they were protest marches going.
After that they were matching Andre.
Guy was standing inside and
they asked him about those.
We would have told him,
told him the commander shooting said sure.
(78:02)
Now I remember there were
several marches there.
We we, we buttoned up the
tech square but we weren't.
We didn't shoot anything ready but but we.
But we did lock up.
You know there were a couple
times when there were.
Flyers distributed saying OK,
you know we're going to get together.
We're going to March 6 square and
we're going to take it over and
trash the place and stuff like that.
So we, you know, kind of like this.
This thing supposedly was the whoever
was was charged security with.
(78:31)
Draper Lab said this is a secured
closed space and if anybody crosses
that line coming into this close,
they will be shot.
Scariest time. Had the ICBM guidance
and so forth. Working on 39 the worm.
Yeah, and I'm not sure.
This might be special,
I'm not sure just exactly what this is.
(79:00)
This doesn't really look like logo no.
It looks like it might be related
to that game of life kind of stuff.
No it's not.
But this might be a circle and then it.
Well, don't don't know 39.
We don't know.
OK, so now we're ready for the fives.
And I'm gonna stop us there if I can.
(79:30)
OK and on Friday if you are up to it then
what I'm a do is I may have you and Heather.
I carry out the interview on because
it'll be about 4:00 o'clock ish again,
yeah, but you're back 'cause you're here
around Tuesdays and Fridays, right?
OK, Friday is a problem for me.
So I may set you up to come in
here and do the same thing, OK?
Very good, so let me stop this recording now.

## 2006-06-02

(0:05)
OK, I think we should be recording
so OK testing 123. Let's see.
Testing 123 testing coming through fire.
OK, let's see where we're up to.
We would think we're ready for
about 50 minutes. You doing?
4040 created through 39.
(0:31)
OK.
OK, so.
Let's see, I need to rethink
my index. Full movie.
Goodnight
OK John John Rowe actually OK that that's.
(1:01)
That's actually a name that I was.
Not able to recover there.
Yeah, John Rowe was a.
A worker in the sort of an
electrical engineer and also
sort of a mechanical engineer.
So he made a lot of these turtles and
circuit boards and that kind of thing.
Let's see OK, let's see this.
(1:32)
Stick figure, yeah.
So because we don't have the head thing.
We might try to speak up.
OK, let's see. OK, so anyway,
this is a stick figure logo. And.
He had some relationship to John Rowe.
Now see that's actually interesting.
This is a different form of. It's.
(2:02)
Come on.
Displays us
yes, it's supernova.
OK, looks like that's that's a little.
Thing there tells me in a little
bit I'm going to what that is.
So so OK so 40 is.
As in note here. Yeah it was.
(2:31)
John Rowe and and, and yeah,
that was. In the school,
as it says here in the note. We we.
One of the things we had at that
stage was a data general supernova,
which is a so-called mini computer.
Of those days it was.
You know, kind of portable
refrigerator side kind of size and.
(3:03)
It was used to to to support
this display so that we
had a display turned on.
And that's what it says.
Here clip it's 40 inch.
So I believe it.
OK, so now 41.
OK, now 41 is Draper Labs,
so I don't know anything about that.
I'll take it quick. Look at it anyway.
(3:36)
This is this. As we discussed.
Due to barriers of various kinds.
We really didn't cooperate in the
AI lab too much with Draper Labs,
but of course they are in my team.
(4:03)
This is safety in here.
It says hey, I laugh.
(4:38)
So it's more automated assembly stuff.
Yeah, it's more automated assembly stuff.
OK, program David Silver.
OK here OK anyway. Anyway,
it is a Japanese visitor to the AI lab.
And he went back to Japan I think.
Became quite prominent in Japan.
And we just went, always done,
but I think quite a bit.
(5:03)
David silver it was an
interesting character in the lab.
He was the son of Rollo Silver,
Roland Silver, Rolo Silver was
a old friend of Marvin Minsky.
And David silver.
I had a form of dyslexia and
in those days we didn't really
understand what dyslexia was and is.
(5:32)
As a result,
he wasn't able to do very well in school,
but he was very talented.
So he came to the Air Lab and he was he, he.
He was able to.
He was telling, especially with
robotics and vision and so forth,
and so he did several different things.
Connected with that.
And he's credited in this.
In this sentence. I'm supportive.
(6:02)
It says the CNO lab.
Supported in part by the units research part.
Yeah, Darbeau is just so,
so that's understandable.
This is Heather.
Hi this is.
OK, well now we're just
getting started here and.
We're looking at a clip 41 and
we have a minor mystery here in
that I don't really remember.
(6:32)
The Oh no wait,
see what he's saying here is that.
So it's an assembly.
And I don't remember
it's too much of that.
However, at the end of it,
it's credited to in a way,
and David Silver of the I lab.
So therefore. Let's see,
why did I think that this was dark.
The page before it said
something about Draper?
Yeah, let's see.
(7:05)
Let's see if that was freaking yeah.
So. Yeah, let's go look. Computer.
So it says at Draper lab, yeah,
those are the comments we got from
the people that used in the films.
So yeah, those were actually on the physical
Fillmore on on on the cassette or something.
Some kind of label.
Anyway, it's a minor mystery that really
looks more to me like Draper Labs,
but it has credit AI lab people
in the AI lab on on the film,
so I don't know what to say about that.
(7:45)
I think David Silver is in
the area somewhere.
I haven't seen him in a number of years,
but I I think I think it might be
possible to to look him up and find him.
Cool. OK, so here that's 41.
Now we go on to 42.
(8:02)
OK, this is more a symbol of radio bearing.
Pictures.
(8:35)
The electrical dust is far
from the rush hour traffic.
All the red tape is mechanical
rate for the TV program.
Stanford.
The only thing about.
Mankind's brother
plastic this was at Stanford.
(9:04)
At least in some of their work.
Went towards a very high speed.
Now they sort of adopted mechanical
engineering approach to things and I think.
But basically that was more
or less to the detriment.
(9:31)
Great risk to to damage itself
and and so forth and so on so.
So anyway. Yeah, I'm at that time.
OK, so let's see here.
Got here. So if that's 42.
OK, so now here we go.
(10:00)
I'm 43 which is back to us.
To these notes.
So let's see what we have 43.
Drunk camera.
OK, now that's a that's a picture off
of the 3:40 that's assembly language
code on the 3:40 that's on the screen.
That person.
(10:30)
It almost looks a little bit like
time makers, but I don't think so.
So. OK, now now here is a a board
that we had for micro tapes.
This is a board we used for storing
these little micro tapes so each one of
these tapes had 65 K of 36 bit words.
Here someone is is mounting a micro tape.
Mystics like it might be rich Zippel.
Here's a console. The PDP 6.
There's a console switches.
(11:01)
There's a run light.
Program counter micro tape goes.
Spin the micro tape controller is
over here to the right there was
a whole 19 inch relay rack which
was just the control for the micro
Cape and something called the data
channel which is just two registers
and buffered it on the way in OK.
Now let's see here we have.
Somebody sitting in an office at.
Text where and who is it?
It is pretty dark.
(11:33)
We could zoom if you want.
I think it might be a good idea.
Yeah, OK, yeah. It's cool.
Come back so we can see him from the side.
Like that and then?
OK, I watch. Still, it's still kind
of dim footage, but oh, I see you.
You did a snapshot and then zoom
so I just paused the movie.
(12:00)
You can play it zoomed in if you want. Since.
After recent.
Thank you, Jack.
How did you know it's built into the apple?
OK, I don't know about it,
so that's a good thing to know.
OK, well anyway I'm not sure who
that first person is, but somebody.
OK, now we go to the second
clip and it's a cube sitting
in the workspace there.
And this is the M farm again.
(12:32)
And. That's in Fr minutes hand.
It comes down on top of the cube.
And now we go to another clip. And.
Moving around something added to chunk
good chunk steps his finger couple times.
This is a cube a couple times.
Oh no.
It's it's really yeah, yeah.
(13:03)
It's painful. Here we go again Gabon.
So this is our take so just exactly why
we have all these ******* here but.
OK.
Here it's going again.
(13:30)
This this arm was very strong as well.
Bond missed it altogether.
I say it's behind them.
Yeah, this this looks does not
show any vision, so I don't believe
that this is gospel program.
This is probably this tower of
annoy program or something.
It's it's just kind of open loop
and didn't really have a way to
locate the cubes or anything.
(14:00)
Bond again. Yeah.
As we see here behind the back, this is this.
This arm is cylindrical
coordinates and the vertical.
Has a square. Radha Vertical square Rod and
then then at the at the base of it there
is a hydraulic motor and the hydraulic
motor turns a square rod and there's a
slider and it is geared to the extent.
(14:35)
OK, now this is the Minsky shoulder.
OK so here we have a differential gear
type of arrangement involving 2 chains and
it was yeah it was a great thing and it
was potentially good but unfortunately.
We were never able to make it work,
you know, for no real good reason
other than you know the software
just really wasn't up to it and.
(15:00)
That was also part of the Minsky Bennett,
Armand, Minsky, Bennett Army, you know.
A little bit more reason you
could appreciate the fact that.
It was, it was hard to control with software
and the software of the day just wasn't
up to doing anything which is too bad,
so it was able to do some things,
but it was all done by driving it
with a little gnome and and just,
you know,
using his remote manipulator.
(15:32)
He's playing with the shoulder.
OK, I'm not playing with the shoulder.
Shoulder driven by 4 hydraulic
cylinders and two Chainz.
OK, this is a hack saw
that we had in those days.
(16:01)
I don't know why they Joes,
but it was fairly gross thing and it could.
Because you ain't cuts or
cuts in big rods, you know.
And and this is this is Bill
Bennett here on the right he was
just ace machinist and that's
the Minsky Bennett arm and those
those bones were mailed out
of solid blocks of aluminum.
This is a bill Henneman on the left.
He later became a professor at BU.
(16:30)
That's Bennett again.
And there is, they've got their
arm mounted on the shoulder and.
Trying to do something with it and OK,
now there's micro tapes
again going spin spin.
There's a PDP6 console
scanning over here to the.
Updated the micro tape controller.
I think it's looking at the lights
on the micro tape controller.
The microchips had absolutely no
electronics whatsoever in the drives.
(17:01)
The drive was was relays to
control the motors and the heads
were just directly run out.
And they've since amplifiers
were there for the heads were
at the end of 10 foot of cable
and selected with Reed relays.
OK, here's Bill Bennett going
at his machining he.
He was quite an advanced machinist
and he really liked to to feed the
metal in there and here he is using
a coolant and and you know basically
really causing the chips to fly.
(17:41)
And we at the time didn't have
any idea what was going on for
quite a period of time.
Our machine was the the physical
computer was located just outside
the door of this machine shop,
and so this mist of atomised oil.
With the flow out,
the door of the machine shop it was.
(18:01)
It was just heavy.
Sometimes you know just sort of a
thick fog and it would go right into
the machine and cause all kinds of
problems and particularly this disk drive.
We had a in some some interval.
We had a disk drive that was dependent
on flying heads and so forth and it
was just you know it caused crashes.
We didn't have any idea why you know it was.
It was sad story.
We've actually got that.
Taken care of, however.
(18:31)
OK,
so here here he is machining away.
It's another person I don't
remember the name of it is is.
This looks a little familiar.
OK now OK here here we have the
Minsky Bennett arm and here he is
driving it by means of an omen.
So this is just a little analog
and has potentiometer's on it
and and then that supplies the
command through the electronics and
causes the arm to move and that's.
(19:05)
That's basically all we were able
really able to do, unfortunately.
Why did you want to do?
Well, it would have been nice
if we could have, you know.
Implemented, you know,
commands that drove it to a special place?
You know, giving place and pick things
up and turn around and separate
out the various degrees of freedom.
(19:30)
But as you see, it has 8 degrees of freedom.
Each bone has two hydraulic cylinders and
they're coupled pretty complicated ways,
although I don't think today it
would really be that much of a
problem to sort it out, but.
Basically,
the computer control they can only.
We are using.
So that's that's sort of
what's being demonstrated here.
It had linear pots in addition to having.
(20:00)
Hydraulic cylinder actuators.
It also some of these things
that we're seeing along the bone
are our linear potentiometer,
so those supply feedback to the
electronics that you know drive it
to a command position and so on.
How did you decide to make?
Point oh, that was just a fake.
I mean, you know there was various
plans for to have other hands,
but we never since we couldn't really
win with the arm we there wasn't
much point making a hand for it.
(20:37)
We sort of tried a little bit, but.
Well, it it was. It was an idea of Minsky.
To make the bone you know like that
and to have have those bones with
two degrees of freedom per bone and
and and four replications of it.
So I had a total of 8 degrees
of freedom here. Here it is Ben.
(21:00)
It kind of has it wrapped around himself.
Kind of elephant trunk style.
And.
Showing that it does work fairly well.
One of the kind of problems that we had
a lot of a lot of devices was play,
and anytime there was play in in one
of these things then then it can.
You can get oscillations and
it makes it very difficult for
electronics to be responsive, but.
(21:34)
Here it doesn't seem to be
having too much trouble, really.
It's pretty awesome. Yeah, he's he's.
He's a little kiss or something you give him.
Let's see here.
Yeah he was a smoker and and in those days
that was another form of air pollution which.
(22:03)
There actually were some people in the
lab who were Bill Gospar, in particular.
His father was a doctor or something
that he was. You used to take a fan
too to Chinese restaurants and things,
and you know somebody would have smoked
that was drifting over the table.
He would set up the fan and try
to blow the smoke back out and.
Trust other things OK.
So this says Gaspers amoeba or grow worm,
but that that isn't right. You know what?
I think our comments got your off,
they're shifted.
(22:38)
You know that that does not
go with that tape.
That's definitely shifted.
Oh, there was a list of ones 'cause OK, OK,
so anyway that that was 43 that has that.
We just looked at and and had that.
The tape can comment does not
apply to that tape.
(23:02)
OK, so now let's try 44 which is 44 logo.
OK, let me get this will do the MP4 just.
OK, and here we are looking at a 35 teletype.
And this is this logo computer
language. Typing away.
(23:41)
The Zoom command is Apple Option 8.
OK, should be. It's a good
thing to know which I. OK.
Well, whoops.
Episode
yeah, so anyway it's printing out a logo
program here to me through some that
it's nothing too interesting. TJ make.
(24:18)
OK, so that just seems to be pretty much
what that tape is. OK, now back here.
(24:30)
Remember what this? Let's see.
Delete should be back.
OK, so anyway that's 44. Not too
interesting, but it is early logo.
OK, so now we're going to go to 45 and.
25 robot
OK, Now this is assemble radio bearing
again this I don't think this this
comment replies to this tape but it looks
like we're off by one or something or.
(25:15)
OK, now working OK now here is a
label on the front which looks
like it was shot off of the 3:40.
You can kind of tell the way that there's
a beat with the refresh of the display
and the and the frame rate of the film.
(25:31)
Here is this one of these eye trackers,
so we had several of these that were,
and again this is being.
I think this is one that demonstrates
it being used as sort of a control
in this little game or something.
Let's see if that's true.
Anyway, that's the 3:40.
Now let's see what we got here.
So here's somebody stepping up into
the eye tracker position here.
So there there's a reflection and.
(26:02)
They can basically look through
and see the screen and also the
device is shining in infrared
light into their eye or something.
OK, now it's done. Pretty dark.
Yeah, I think this is. Again,
some kind of a of a control
task trying to demonstrate.
(26:37)
OK, now now we go to another clip here.
About halfway through the film.
OK, this. Yeah, what we're
seeing here for a moment. Is.
Is a. Yes, maybe it's not part of it.
I think that may be part of the eye tracker.
I mean, yeah it was a short
clip of a of an oscilloscope.
(27:02)
And built into a kind of
a table like arrangement.
And I think that maybe this somewhere here
it said something about NASA ITRACKER,
but maybe. We we we didn't make
these eye trackers so much ourselves,
but we kind of got them.
Minsky was interested in it.
He was and so he had several contacts and one
of them was with a group somewhere at NASA.
I have no idea where and.
(27:30)
I think they're the ones who made this OK,
now here we go.
There's Marvin minsky.
Here's the Minsky Bennett arm here.
Here he is waving it around.
Prosthetic hand yeah this is just a fake
and which again is just just for laughs.
Yeah now here is this oscilloscope.
And. Yeah, I don't know what.
I I remember that piece of hardware,
I don't remember exactly what it is actually.
(28:02)
OK, this is here.
We are on the 3:40 it looks like.
And it looks like we're the
arm is is over some cubes.
So I guess they.
340 is trying to serve as is sort of
like a viewfinder for the camera which.
Is an interesting thing.
Of course it is very hard to do that.
In other words, this this visual device.
We couldn't since we couldn't
hold even one frame in memory,
we had this random access camera
device called a video sector and it's
something we had to make ourselves up
from from basically practically nothing.
(28:40)
And it was a magnetic deflection device.
OK, here it is, finding a cube,
and so we see here.
It's kind of crawling around
and you can see on the 3:40.
Where it's it's looking.
It's kind of.
Crawling around in the cube in there that
match found found the internal edges,
and then there's the cute and wow. OK,
here's the chest display again on the 3:40.
(29:07)
And here we are.
Here it is again finding cubes.
It was really pretty painful
to find cubes and.
And so forth, but it did find a few.
OK,
more chess.
Let's not here. OK,
now here we are in the middle of a game.
(29:31)
OK, here's Alan Baisley this this fellow
at the Teletype here now is Alan Baisley.
He was a chess master.
It was a long story connected with him.
Yeah. He wrote his own chest program.
It was called Tech 2 and he
entered it in in some of the.
Computer chess championships.
It was a brute force program.
It was.
It was a refinement of the technology
program that was originated.
(30:01)
At Carnegie Mellon,
there was an idea that they had,
which was to write a simple program just
program in a form that would be portable and
then just to hold that program constant.
And as the years went by,
the computers would get faster and
the program would get faster and the
idea was that this would serve as a
calibration point and you would see
how much of the improvement in the
playoff chess was due to simply.
(30:31)
The speed of the computer and
nothing else and.
So basically
was a good coder and and there was
this PDP nine that that had belonged
to the kludge it was floating around
and so he coded up a just a tech
program for the PDP nine and so I
think this may very well be what this
is even though this looks like a 340
type of display I don't think it is.
(31:01)
I think this this one actually might be this,
this this I think is my chest program.
Always playing here but but he
had one of his own.
But it was. It was pure beautiful force.
It didn't have any heuristics
in it or anything. It was.
This idea was just simply
to examine the tree.
So many plies deep and then
examine captures beyond that.
OK, now here's the console of
the PDP 6 area 35 teletype.
(31:33)
There's some it looked like
there was some 33 teletypes so.
Here's a Minsky Bennett arm.
Here's Minsky waving it
around vehicle Norman.
And it's attached to the shoulder.
OK, there's a 35 teletype that
was primary input device.
In those days many years.
Let's see, it looks like this is you
can see a little bit of a console
in the 3:40 display over here.
(32:09)
OK, we got here.
OK, now that this is is a what's called
a flip chip this this this strip.
Here is a panel of digital logic.
In that bad, I think that goes with this.
(32:31)
Presented video sector.
Maybe that was a control for the vivisector?
We we had several video
sectors that we had made and.
I'm thinking maybe that was
a control for one of them.
OK, here we are looks like.
I'm putting some.
(33:00)
Looks like trying to find some
cubes on a table or something.
And that's the end of it.
I guess that's 45. OK, so now.
We're going to go on here to 46 robot.
OK, it's labeled as Stanford AI.
However, it's not. So again,
here we got the labels off. OK.
(33:33)
Ralph has written a program with OK.
Now this is Dave Walz.
Recognize his voice disabled.
Specify the physical nature
of each individual line.
There are labels for shadows.
Obscuring edges convex
edges and concave edges.
Physical constraints limit the number
of ways that seem features conform
vertices most combinations of line labels
simply cannot occur at any junction.
(34:06)
Oh yeah, OK well. Also,
this program has been here the past corners,
and so he's talking about
that as election of labeling,
like the Assembly of the Juice of Puzzle,
because previous elections
strongly limit each new choice.
In our sample scene,
the L junction starts with a complete
set of 123 possible labelings.
And this number is immediately reduced to
76 because the relative region brightness
is preclude certain shadow labelings.
(34:37)
Yeah.
Next, the mutual constraints
between junctions have an effect.
Sierra labelings are reduced from
the initial 79 to 52 compatible
with the neighboring El.
Similarly, only 32.
Working with faculty member at Brandeis
and he he was thinking machines for
long and then announced that the
particular junction can cause and effect
propagate for considerable distance.
(35:08)
They propagate through the drawing
a connectivity drives at junctions
where no new changes are forced.
During the year of of sort
of Japanese ascendancy,
there was a time when everyone thought
the Japanese were going to take over
the world and the Japanese dollar
again was very high against the dollar,
and so on and so forth.
So anyway, at that time a bunch of
Japanese companies invested in in.
(35:32)
Do US and and and in this area and they
establish this institute down there.
And and Dave Walsh ran it.
And.
Well, they they they did some stuff actually,
as several of the people out of that project.
Decamp to to Google,
and by the time the left somebody
senior overall arrangement typically
forces distinguish interpretation
for the entire
scientific journal on basically trying
to retrieve text and information in
general from Scientific Journal,
which I'm still being here.
(36:10)
I'm interested in as well.
OK, so anyway, that's. 36
OK, and this is definitely not does not
go with that title of Butterfinger, OK?
OK, so now we go to clip 47.
OK, it says Bill Bennett arm.
(36:30)
Let's see if that turns out to be true.
Labels are displaced. Yeah OK the number.
Yeah, something like that yeah.
So anyway 47 according to me is.
My notes here are supposed to be MF.
So let's see what we've got here.
(37:01)
OK, there's a time that was.
So this indeed is is a promotional
film from the company that made the.
Trap. So automatic transfer machine
represents a new generation of the
evolution of automatic transfer,
positioning and handling equipment.
Designed to eliminate the need for costly,
single is really pretty funny
reversal trading world.
(37:30)
This star road and operating as a
wide variety of production machines,
it can be moved from application to
application and reprogrammed to do new jobs.
It has the capability of
our morning celebration.
Play guns.
Perform temperatures requiring continuous,
so the way you did this was you lead
the arm through the the notion that
you wanted it to make and then it round
the tape and it it recorded from one
to the other something so you didn't
have two copies of this tape and then
it had it logic so that it would play
play 1 tape and Wormwood go through its
design sequence and then then while
that take new wines it would play.
(38:17)
And so basically high and measuring
27 by 45 inches,
it occupies only eight and a half
square feet of floor space.
Two types of control systems are
available point to point which
has capacity for a great many
straightforward transfer operations.
(38:35)
We surely we got it when we got our.
It had nothing like that tweet during
the program and the great many
individual positions within a program.
Two electronic drivers so.
With 240 this disc. Original thing was.
Central Operational area covers
60 cubic feet of space.
(39:03)
The control console for continuous
path seen at the left houses
the twin tape transport system.
Tips to program versatrans.
Basically,
we've actually looked pretty moving to joint,
which is really moved in the direction of
ARM travel desires up or down computers.
Later, nice signal in or out.
(39:30)
Command so so you preset hand
functions are programmed by a pistol,
drifts which it had a little
zero to 180 degrees.
Wrist week Webster right zero to 180 degrees
rotation clockwise or counterclockwise.
Jog gauges and stuff.
And so you could use that to to
guide the arm around as you wanted.
But so it's more that it's more that.
(40:02)
OK, so that was that was the first time.
Again, whoops. Alright, so that was.
47 So now we're ready for 48.
48 worm, but I don't think it is.
Let's see what it is.
OK, this is the bubble thing and.
(40:33)
Yeah, I think this is by Spencer,
but I'm not sure and.
And Gaspar Gaspar may know something
about it, because as I said,
the other day when I called him
up recently and just advised him
that these clips had been found
he out of the blue, asked me,
did you find the bubble thing?
And I said, yeah, there is.
I don't know anything about it,
but so he may.
He may possibly have something
interesting to say about it if he ever,
and she got to get ahold of him.
(41:05)
Well, not really. I mean it,
just it just bubbles and it's.
That way they just do patterns and yeah.
OK, and then we went.
Well, there we go. That's it, yeah.
OK, so that's that's what that seems to be,
though it's it's 48.
(41:31)
Yeah, OK, so now now we go for 49.
It's 49. According to my notes,
49 is a 340 logo turtle
actually come to think of it,
this might very well be the supernova turtle.
OK, yeah, there it is.
It's a display turtle,
it's running around.
And.
It's very possible that that this.
(42:04)
The the display. I think.
In one of these other pictures,
we saw a shot of it.
There was a particular technology
that that HP had made,
which made a fairly fast,
randomly positioned point plotting display.
And it was fairly cheap, like $1500,
which was much cheaper than earlier ones in,
and it was also it had some kind of a
magnet electron magnification thing in it,
and so it was.
(42:37)
It was more comparable to a TV set
and in its size of the Catholic
grade tube as opposed to these
humongous big capillary tubes in
it and also didn't have you know,
the the magnets that deflected the beam
and so forth were relatively moderate size.
So so that that display was used
driven by this supernova computer.
(43:02)
And that was how we could make display
turtles in the schools and so forth,
and so quite a few of these
displays they the.
The downside of this display was that
the point size was not very good, so.
If you when you see this and
this is kind of looks like it,
I would say this is, you know,
the point is is not very finely focused,
and so the 3:40 was quite high.
(43:33)
More focus, so I think that this
is probably shot off of that.
OK, so anyway, that's what that is.
That's a display turtle.
49 OK, so now we go on 250.
OK now 50 is is a view out of the
window. And so this is actually
interesting to some people this.
(44:08)
Yeah, this this is here we see the parking
lot there there where the Draper lab is now.
That was all just an open parking lot.
Here is the tire factory which is
over there where the where the other.
I guess they're they're the deactivating
part of the Draper lab is weather building
that and this all was an industrial.
Here's the railroad track here we see.
(44:32)
Lots of pollution, you know.
In those days there was all kinds of
gases going on in Cambridge. They.
The power plant burn coal down close
to the river, so there was OK here.
Here again we see just across
the street across Hampshire St.
And. Lots of.
This and that. Here's
more of the parking lot.
(45:09)
Soon.
It was a car. I said the air out which.
You know, we're pretty much cars,
although they they look different.
They got us around.
They weren't anywhere
near as reliable and they.
Like other problems.
(45:32)
But
OK, so that's that's that.
That's that. Tape 50.
OK 51 cube.
51 OK, 51 is supposed to be the solar corona.
OK again that the comments here are are off.
OK, there's the emef arm.
(46:00)
Now there it is running around OK now.
Now here it is going to get this.
It's trying to get the gnome and
there's a magnet holder there.
And oh, I see,
and they know when he gospar has in his hand.
So he's he's only now dropping it in there.
So it realizes that it it
it it it has scripted.
It does have that much force sense
and now it's moving it around.
And it moves it and then it searches
for it with the video sector and
it finds it and it establishes
the coordinate transformation.
(46:37)
And here we're looking at the
3:40 and we're and it's able to.
Essentially,
do a reverse transform and you see.
You know what the grippers would look like,
reprojected back to the to the 3:40.
And OK, so it's moving around and it.
(47:03)
Calibrates itself in this.
This is probably the best thing
that this thing really did is,
as far as I'm concerned.
In terms of actually doing
something useful besides just
kind of managing to barely work,
which is with so much work in those days,
and it was really very
hard to get anything done.
But so but.
OK, so here it is. Going
through this calibration OK now.
(47:33)
No, I guess it's calibrated and it's
again we're looking at the 341.
Seeing the projections,
I think this is some kind of a of
a check that shows a difference
in the calibration or something,
but it just did.
OK, and these triangles I think it is.
I think it took six positions
so that that represents the.
(48:01)
Is 6. Inputs of the Norman at 6
different positions of the arm,
and then it solves equations,
stab Lish transformations.
OK, now there it is putting the Naumann
back in place and it's if it works,
it's able to do that without assistance.
It can just sort of put it back up there.
It will. The magnet will kind of
go catch unk and then they can
just let go of it and let it go.
So looks like he has to help it in this one,
but it did.
It was able to to pick it up and put it back.
(48:33)
Without assistance, fairly well.
I was feeling happy.
Had that.
OK, here's gospar demonstrating that
that again there is a slight amount
of force feedback on the fingers and
he can just push it to at the fingers
and and the arm will will move back.
And that's that's good as far as it goes.
But that's not it.
Doesn't go too far so.
It's as we saw with the other program.
(49:03)
It it's it's capable of coming down on
top of something and going minds and
not really realizing what it's doing.
Here is the video sector again
searching for Cuban, just hanging
around and eventually finding it,
and now it's going to send the arm down,
picks up, picks the cube up.
Sure enough, picks it up.
And shows the gripping shows at moving.
(49:31)
Puts it down somewhere so so so
that's hand eye coordination.
That's that's another good
thing that this did not up here.
Here's the video said here's
one of the video sectors.
We had two video sectors
that worked pretty well.
This is a small one.
And.
It. And that was its thing.
It it it was pretty slow.
I mean, I think it was probably.
50 microseconds or more
to to read in a point.
(50:02)
So you know it was not.
It was fairly high resolution.
But you know to use it as a TV would be.
Pretty hard,
because you know there's a lot of
points there and the rate of reading
in a full frame would be several
seconds per frame or something.
Even if you could hold all
the data which you couldn't.
OK, here it is, picking up cubes.
(50:31)
And now I think it's doing
a certain thing maybe.
We see this. To the left of the vertical.
I think we see the square rod which is
is coupled to the extent and so that's.
That's how they extend works
and it was very strong.
(51:03)
It was a big hydraulic motor.
It was a 5 horsepower hydraulic
source and the extent of the MFOM
could really deliver a punch if it.
Something went wrong and it
decided to do that. It was.
It was very dangerous and I was just
earlier today talking with Gerry Sussman
was December was relating some story
about the thing was vibrating towards
him and just about punched and so forth.
OK, I wasn't there at the time,
but that's a good story.
(51:34)
Actually, assessment was.
Well, basically.
The.
Yeah it it.
It was controlled by.
These hydraulic servovalves and they
were very sensitive and very high quality
control when everything was working right.
However, there's a lot of
wires being moved around here.
(52:00)
They they fray and they developed.
Breaks and, you know.
Intermittency sometimes and then
when that happens you know all
hell breaks loose because you know
you're not getting your feedback
and then all of a sudden it makes
contacting you do and you know that.
Really, really can be quite dangerous,
and apparently that happened.
Assessment same point.
At least that's a story.
Or it wasn't me that was telling the story.
It was me that was listening to the
story and it wasn't us when he was
telling me he was so, so it's anyway.
(52:34)
OK, so here we are picking up cubes.
I'm sweating tubes and and and that's
pretty much what that clip is,
that's 51.
So now we go back to 52.
And 52 is sure OK.
(53:02)
Sure, Lou. Is this?
OK, so this is this is off the
3:40 and this is a simulation.
It's not a physical simulation,
but it's actually rather good
simulation of the blocks world.
And here we have cubes and some are
pyramids and there's a box and so on,
so you can ask it questions.
Had quite an elaborate English
language interface and it would
respond to the questions and
then you could give it commands.
(53:34)
How many blocks are not in the box.
Four of them says, and so on like that.
This was basically the work of three people,
primarily at Terry Winograd
did the linguistics?
Adjustment I think did microplanet.
And then Eugene Czerniak also
had a thesis out of this,
and I don't remember exactly what his did.
There may be something you can
do with a database or something.
I've watched a couple of these and
it's really got great English, yeah?
Yeah, that's a little bit misleading
and that it was really that good,
but it still was.
(54:11)
It was a.
A good English thing,
particularly for this day.
And and so when you give it a command,
it will sort of simulate
picking up your arm and.
Sort of watched on.
Doing the command. And.
(54:32)
It's it was a good piece of work,
so yeah. Yeah.
So it's doing that.
OK so 52 is sure. Pretty good
clip the whole thing. OK 53.
OK, 53 is a Walsh finger.
(55:04)
OK, well here we have a little
device which has tendons and
we can see here it's it's it's.
It has little screws and and.
And whatever,
and it's fairly flexible and they can,
there's several degrees of freedom,
and it can actually grips things.
And so it was potentially a
nice little finger.
Unfortunately, we never really got it to.
(55:31)
To do too much, did I remember anyway,
but but again it was.
It's a good idea for how to.
To get several degrees of freedom going and.
In your face. Without too much worked
its way out on the end and so forth.
Yeah, and so. So. Yeah, and it just
uses little DC electric motors,
so it's it's not dangerous or anything.
(56:04)
Work pretty well.
OK, I'm here. Illustration of
the motors in the gears and.
Various winding things and so on.
OK. So 4053 is the waltz finger.
(56:34)
54
is bongo well. I don't think we even
waste time on that if this is bongo. Yeah,
there's quite a few kids on bongo boards.
These are logo kids and not too much
more that can be said about it. OK 55.
It was related to something they were doing,
but the films interested.
Yeah, there this their their overall
idea of bound of balance was.
(57:04)
I've seen in you know that there was
several aspects to that, and so I mean OK,
here we have the video sector. And.
Looking at some seen here
we got this fake hand.
That's the first clip.
Would he commit again? Who?
And. We we, we called this when TV.
(57:37)
If I'm if I'm not mistaken this
small business sector was called
TVB and and there was another one
which we made winding the coils
and made right from the ground up.
This guy John Rd did and that
one was called TVC and they
were both business actors.
They were pretty high resolution.
(58:00)
OK, now this fellow I'm not.
I want to say Sol Linowitz.
I'm not sure what his name is,
but that's that's why.
Ignore it too well, but. He he.
I think he had a A A contour
Finder and so I think that that
this may be what this is here is.
So here here represents an early
attempt to use this thing as a scam.
As you see it's it's it's.
It's very slow as a scam,
but you do get into raster
and you can do contours and
find things a little bit so.
(58:38)
In that sense,
it was kind of looking ahead, but.
Original input was really.
Pretty limited in those days.
Raster really.
Oh wow, OK and here here is he's.
He's actually taking a picture of his head.
He signed a cedar with contours.
It's funded here.
OK, now here's a good one.
(59:00)
This? OK, let's this is
Alan Kotok and Stu Nelson.
Let's take a look at this a little
bit and see I that's George Mitchell.
On the left there I believe.
And so Alan Kotok was, you know,
the code designer of this PDP 6.
Is that is that that's not nice.
It's not me.
The person looking over his shoulder.
I'm not sure who is. Right, yeah,
now is it just yesterday or we could go?
Alan kotok. Yeah I'm sorry.
(59:35)
Two days ago yesterday two
days ago two days ago.
OK yeah OK great.
There was a confusion as to when he died.
I just learned of it last night and.
Matthew is really quite a
spectacular guy, and so forth anyway.
Anyway, he.
(60:01)
He was the Co. Designer of this PDP 6.
The engineers in those days that
they had sort of a senior one and
a junior two guys worked as a team.
So on the PDP 6 Gordon
Bell was a senior engineer.
Alan Kotok was a junior engineer.
Alan Kotok had had graduated at MIT.
He did a chess program and
McCarthy chess program.
It was his thesis and so on.
That was just before I came.
And he was in a member of
the Mile Railroad club.
(60:32)
He was very prominent.
Quite a figure at the mall.
Very little club in a lot of ways.
He then worked for deck and this
this picture I think was taken in
the very early days of the PDP6
when we just just had gotten. So.
I I don't know if these clips are in order,
that wouldn't necessarily. Anyway,
this fellow here is a student, Nelson,
and he's also quite a famous hacker and.
(61:04)
Right, he is. He's still around.
He was not here around here,
but I'm in contact with him he.
But he.
It's done a number of
things and and including.
The essay 10. There's company called
Systems Concepts and and they did things
for the PDP tending and included after
decade abandoned the PDP 10 and it's a
little bit before then to these folks
made their own PDP 10 re engineered it,
made it run much faster and just
with a very very small company.
(61:46)
Sold a bunch of them and it was a company
called CompuServe which was quite
prominent in the early timesharing.
CompuServe used PDP 10s and a bunch of
them they got from this SC company.
(62:00)
Anyway still not a whole lot of
other things about Steve Nelson.
He is close friend of mine so he still is OK.
So here we are at the console of
the PDP 10 there's code talkers,
the micro tapes in the background and
machine in the background. Haven't.
OK, now I see what we got here.
I believe this guy on the right standing
behind is possibly Mark Oberly.
And he was just a friend at the
mall railroad club.
(62:33)
Yeah, now you can see the.
This this location of where the
machine is is in the early days you
can see here the door behind it
and you can see a little bit of.
I'll come back there that that's the
aisle running back toward the 1794,
so that was the original location
of the machine just after it was
delivered in in the early days.
After a year or so, we're not too long.
(63:00)
We built the raised floor and and
we kind of moved the machine to
the other side of the building.
OK, now this is this person who's
standing up behind these guys.
I still. Don't do it. Get who that is.
He's also somebody else sitting
behind them, which I don't.
Recognize.
OK anyway, so that's some code
talking Nelson that is. 55
remembered now. Yeah, yeah
yeah, I'm not sure anyways.
(63:45)
Is that? Uh.
Mostly no, I think I think he
is later I I was that was more
contemporary of these guys.
Although I sometimes was
around a Mile River club. Yeah.
(64:03)
Each question. OK, so.
OK, so that was 55.
Which are going to be six?
Yeah, just 11.
That's what I said but OK,
so now we're ready for 56.
Sorry it's very sensitive.
Here we go 56.
Right down here. OK. And.
(64:33)
I think it actually yeah this this.
OK, there's a guy named the famous
thing thing that was done with life
at these days. Was Bill gospar.
Bill Gospar became the world
expert on life and discovered a
number of cities puffer trains,
and I'm not sure what all it's it's.
It's documented and they spent a lot
of time just staring at this screen
and then looking at these things,
noticing things and.
(65:06)
But, and this I'm not so sure this
might be possibly be Bill graspers,
or actually I think Bill Man wrote,
wrote the program.
Bill Gospar actually mainly
just programmed the life.
At the cellular automata level,
he didn't write the underlying
program that much, I don't think.
So yeah, this this is possibly build gospar.
(65:35)
Dot com it's a little right.
Yeah it has a few little annotations here.
Extent period there are all
kinds of studies of periodic.
In terms of various things and so on,
it was really. Find a log.
Working in OK.
Here's the glider gun this is.
He's still kaspers intervention 99,
pretty sure. And.
(66:02)
And this this is sort of a
theoretically important thing
that when there's initially done,
it wasn't clear that that you could
have a thing that would have a number
you know in the sending number,
but the number of dots would
just go up indefinitely,
and then so that was a glider gun was.
Drone forever and then then then once
they got that then they did a whole
lot of things about glider streams,
intersecting and making things and
doing all kinds of things and so.
(66:36)
Hospital bed and then they.
They also had something called
a puffer train there where a
big thing moves along and.
Who does that matter?
We got a lot of other things.
The problem was of course this was
before the days of time sharing, so.
This is, yeah, I think this is Gaspar.
(67:01)
Let's get that.
So that is 56 is gaspar's life,
so it's good to have that.
So anyway, yeah, I mean basically
from the lab's point of view,
it was a problem that you know,
we here we had this one machine.
We only had no time sharing on it
or anything, and yet I'm tying it
up to watch these this life thing.
This was something that we you know we had
to do some concerns about senior now I think.
(67:33)
Or will be a senior?
He's built.
He took printed circuit boards with
16 LEDs and a little microcontroller,
and you can you can just they
have interfaces on each side,
so he had the hundreds of unprinted and he
just sat him together and it plays like.
But he can.
He can just it's infinitely
extensible According to him.
(68:01)
Well, that that is a thing.
Of course you know.
It's a simplification to have
just a toy toy doned OK now.
Here is some kind of a math maxima thing,
and the question is which one is it?
As we were. Discussing the other day,
there's. There's basically two
different mathematics programs
that were going on at this time.
(68:31)
One of them was this.
This guy Engelmann from from my dad who
was really just a guest and visitor and and
his thing really wasn't well, it was OK.
I mean, he was a good hack,
but you know I didn't leave that much.
And Mitre, being a government would dependent
upon government funding and so forth they do.
They do really have the
resources security too far.
The other one, of course,
was Joe, Moses, and Maxima.
And that of course had
had quite a bit longer.
(69:02)
Life in there they they had a group of
graduate students who did quite a bit of.
Innovation in mathematics
connected with this thing so.
This program established a following
and was used for many years and and.
Has a long story unfortunately it.
It did not. Develop that as well as
it might add, that's another story.
(69:34)
OK, so anyway, I'm not positive that
based on this which which one this is?
If this is engelmann's or if this is Moses.
That's my mother. OK, so that's 57.
OK, let me have 58.
OK this this again.
(70:02)
They're not even close at this point.
OK, now this. This is this I track is
sort of evaluating it as an input device.
So here we have a little thing and this is.
You know trying to follow follow where the
guy's looking at and so he looks at it,
and that's that's just sort of
a demonstrating how that works.
And then somewhere here.
We get a little game because we just played.
(70:32)
See if this is on this film.
Yeah, this is it.
The one with the diamonds.
Yeah, there's two diamonds and one ones
being controlled by the eye tracker,
the others being controlled by
joystick and and there's a little
it's a little hockey game.
There's a ball and then the idea is.
Is this done? Looks like it's just.
Yeah, I tracker just being demonstrated
a little bit not working too well,
but working a little bit I guess.
(71:02)
OK, so that is 58 now.
We're ready for a 59 as as bongo.
My notes say that 59 Cynthia
Solomon is is on that one,
so I won't bother that.
But she is thinking that Solomon
was a person involved in the lab
for a long time and had quite a
history and she was like they say OK.
Now here it says Krakauer.
But it goes. This is bongos.
(71:32)
Yeah, so it's like the title
of the film is funding.
I think it's pretty well,
maybe it may it may.
I think maybe the title was done by Crocker,
right? See that, but yeah, OK anyway, yeah.
OK so 60 is too much.
OK 61.
Yeah.
OK, 61 is the. OK.
(72:04)
OK, here we are. OK this is a video
sector finding cube searching around.
Looks like it's found one.
What's going on?
Did they have zoom or something?
Oh well, the camera zoomed deck OK.
Now here's Lucy.
Lucy was Professor Minsky secretary.
During an era she was very petite and
this this was really a great thing.
(72:32)
We put a cover over this Minsky Bennett arm.
And she just had a great time
riding it like this is a city.
So she's just kind of riding
like an elephant's trunk.
It's.
And Bill Bennett in the background,
operating the arm. And that's the
best thing that I've ever did.
(73:05)
OK.
OK, so that's that one. OK.
OK, so that was 61.
So now we're ready for 62 so.
So the time we got here, we had.
(73:31)
OK, so here we are in 62.
After over 15 minutes,
it's probably good.
OK, so now let's see what this is.
OK, this is this.
I track thing it looks like.
It is. Personality I track.
Someone that I tracked.
62 is just. I track it a little bit.
(74:03)
OK.
63 test test.
OK yeah, this is a game.
This is looks like it's
probably shot off to 3:40.
Not entirely positive is it looks
probably is pretty sure it is,
although it's a slight chance
it might be baseless program.
(74:33)
Please run on this PDP 7.
I had a similar split.
I think this one is probably mine.
Wow. OK, that would reset the board.
Here we are going to the end of the game.
I'm not working right now,
so it might be an interesting game,
I don't know. OK, I'm there. Yeah, yeah.
(75:05)
Yeah, Oh yeah, I know who this is
this is Chuck Chuck Chuck somebody.
Yeah, this last name is.
OK, so let's check something.
He was just a lab member for awhile now.
2 terribly prominent. OK.
He's also a member of Moderate club.
(75:31)
OK, now who's this?
So Michael.
Again, I'm not entirely
positive, for that is.
He's sitting on the chair.
OK, OK hold on.
There's Jack Holloway.
Oh, here's a good one.
OK, we've got three people
here and the center one.
(76:04)
Is Jack Holloway.
So just after he gets tired.
Yeah, we only a few frames where we have
a fairly decent picture of Jack Holloway.
The other two people in this family.
Exactly who you are. Who is Jim Taylor?
Jack and that's Bill Gospel.
They're going to the next cut.
(76:30)
Jack Holliway was a gifted programmer, and.
And hardware person. And he was.
In the same class as do Nelson
one year. Behind me and so.
He was a primary person in a lot of these
things, and then he also had a lot of
history after this and various things.
(77:02)
He he helped engineer the chess
machine and they and they they.
On some cattle machines. And he.
Oh he he, he wrote,
he made the original Ethernet transceiver.
You know we had a form of of of
of Ethernet which called chaos.
Now, shouldn't these chaos not translate?
So Ethernet was developed at Xerox Parc.
(77:35)
But and we thought we knew it
was good but we couldn't buy it,
it was before it was available as a product.
So we developed one ourselves
called Chaos mode and.
It had a 10 megahertz data rate
whereas the original Ethernet at
Xerox Parc was only three minutes.
I think there's something like that,
so considerably slower and
it it had a an elaborate.
(78:06)
Electronic design we had a
cable underneath the street,
so basically we had a link to
building 38 from Tech square and
and it worked with the chaos
and we had at the peak we had.
I would guess somewhere around.
Between 50 and 100, maybe,
maybe sister saying I don't know
quite a few castnet nodes,
wow.
(78:34)
Interface was was a quad HyunA bus board.
We have these boards and all the calders.
Well, that's right,
that was 35 just right there for
the characters and then we had
them in the deck 20s all the time,
sharing systems I had it and and then
a few other machines around campus.
They they architecture machine people,
which is the predecessor of a media lab.
(79:00)
They had. They had chaos,
connection connect and so on.
So it was kind of predecessor
before Ethernet was available.
OK, now here we go with the this
is Bill Gospar sitting here
and somebody has a hand up for
almost looks like lovely late.
I'm not sure whose hand that is.
However he don't play tell.
(79:30)
I don't see what you think.
Hopefully it's not. Nothing else.
It puts you see around anyway.
It doesn't look like very
serious creatures staring at.
Let me just. Something or other?
OK, well watch that.
We got excited. Firefox.
(80:05)
OK, so now let's see.
If it's too late. OK, so that is 63,
and that's not chess.
OK, now let's see where we go for.
Oh no, there were some tests on
that actually wasn't too bad.
Yeah, OK. So now here we go 64
and this I have noted this is.
(80:38)
Moses
yeah, OK, that's Joe Moses and
here he is typing at at 2741
which is a IBM Selectric chairman
is probably interface to CTSS.
I think this is the days
before Multics might have.
Trying to do something I don't think.
(81:01)
I don't think it was Multics.
Emphasis CCSS, so there he is,
taking away. And.
Again, this is looks like it's maximum.
Yeah, probably just taking all this.
Problem.
OK, and here's integrate sine X cosine X.
(81:30)
OK, so this this is that was his
thesis was integral calculus.
He did a bunch of stuff on that,
and we've done it for years and.
There was a big piece of Maxim.
It was immigration.
Now exactly. What is his though I
don't know what your this is this now
at a later stage maximum did run on
Multics and these 2741 terminals we
normally use with CTSS and MULTICS.
(82:04)
Now I I don't know.
Well, they did have a list under Ctes too.
But no, I don't think they got
too far with it too, because.
It wasn't enough for me.
We had, I think,
a few times just for short term period.
Sorry, we had 2741 interface to
the to the PDP 10 via something
but normally one would not use
this terminal and it was not a.
(82:35)
A normal thing at all is possible
that this might might have been
one of those times, however.
This is actually the previous
weekend that's driving this thing,
so I'm not sure about that.
It depends upon what era.
They must take it.
OK, but but anyway the.
CTSS and maxima folks and
Multics folks wound up using
these selected terminals.
(83:07)
Multics had originally been
designed for Type 37 teletype,
but they turned out to be losers, so.
They wound up with using that.
OK, so that was 64. OK now we go for 65.
Here.
(83:32)
OK, here we have a display turtle.
This might very well be the
supernova display channel.
OK.
OK, so I think that's
what that is. Interesting.
(84:03)
Now let's see 66. Interesting yeah,
OK, but it's not really natural.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. These are.
And again, this is based on a
raster type of thing which which in
the days of the video sector was.
(84:31)
Very unusual and you know late,
later of course you have a raster
type TV interface maintenance,
a lot of sense, but.
The time this was done it was.
Yeah.
Alright. Anyway, yeah that.
(85:04)
So let's say 66. Now go to 67.
67 life.
Yeah. Oh no, that's right.
This is not like this is.
There's a guy named Robert Roger Banks.
(85:30)
And. He did a bunch of work
on so our time and this.
This is the duplication demonstration
with their 4X or each each cell being
replaced by by the by the extrava
for nearest neighbors I believe
and and basically demonstrates
that after just a few cycles it
has a replication aspect to it.
(86:01)
Then this is the bank's constructor.
So what we see here is a.
Two things shooting from
the top and the bottom.
And depending upon the
exact phase at which the.
Two things hit then it either turns
around or doesn't or whatever.
Basically causes this.
This arm out here to extend the retract.
And then as you see there it can.
(86:33)
It can make itself go away
and leave something behind,
so here it's gone through all that
trouble and it's actually left that
that one dot and that that dot is there.
And So what this is able to do
is construct an arbitrary or
relatively arbitrary pattern.
Under program control,
all within the cellular rules
of the cellular common interest.
(87:00)
And so it it makes various things I.
I think this I don't know
if this was worth making MIT
or something like it's yeah.
Oh, look at that.
It's just something there.
Well. Into the hacker,
he says 67. I'm OK.
Select banks constructor.
OK 68 is supposed to be.
(87:31)
There's no gas again. About
yeah, let's move down.
Surround.
(88:02)
Switch. I think it was the 69.
I'll be last one.
69
Yep. Yes.
Sure.
Alright, so. Good deal.
OK, so yeah, I guess we'll
go ahead again on Tuesday.
(88:35)
OK yeah I have to fix this database.
I knew something wasn't
quite right, but. And.
Well, as you fix it.
Well, it's I. I guess my comments
are based on the on the name,
so if you shuffle the comments then
that won't screw up my annotations.
(89:02)
I mean, yeah, it's probably what
movies is going to do, so yeah.
So so yeah. Adam couple
things I have to do on this.

## 2006-06-09

(0:00)
But but yeah.
Wow, that's pretty impressive.
Let's see how we've got here.
OK, now we've got to find our link here.
Number.
(0:35)
Let's see.
It's here somewhere.
There it is.
OK, So what where do we want to pick up here?
I forget where we starting.
(1:02)
Are we starting again at?
Well, yeah, we lost.
With Tuesday, so we want to start it.
We essentially want to do over
what we did on Tuesday, OK?
But I don't know exactly.
Let's see. I think it was at 60.
Yeah, that sounds right.
Well, I think yeah,
I think actually I think maybe in 70.
(1:30)
Actually I think it's we
started off with these things.
Yeah, really quick, OK?
OK, so we're going to start
off here and this is Friday.
The 9th of June 2006 and.
And basically 6968 sixty nine and
70 are all special needs gas,
and we're all pretty non interesting.
(2:02)
OK, and then 71 was the ETL.
Arm vision and drum.
So that was doesn't have to do with us.
It's I don't know if we're positively
certain that it's from ETL, but it's.
It's not from here then. 72 was gas.
And had the heart thing on at 73
was also a little bit of gas.
74 was a bongo attempt
with a 180 degree jump.
(2:34)
75 was logo, big Turtle with some
drawing and also some looking at the.
At a 35 teletype doing logo
76 was Mahabala vision,
which Mahabala was a Pakistani.
He he was a graduate student here.
I believe there was a picture of
him that we got of fairly good.
(3:01)
He did some vision and we also
got a fairly good picture of the
video sector which was this video
input device with the random
access deflection that we.
Made ourselves or actually that one.
I think we,
I think that one was made by tripolye.
That view is is the generation of
video sector that was in these films.
We later had something called TVC.
OK 77 was life Allah Roger Banks so.
(3:34)
Roger Banks was a guy
who worked with Fredkin.
He worked on cellular autonomous Thomas.
We had, I think earlier
in this thing we had a a.
A show of of him doing a constructor,
and this was just simulating
some seller Tom and his his
cellular automata could do life,
but it could also do other games.
(4:03)
It was somewhat more general
rules than than just life and so
I think that that that clip was
essentially a demonstration of that.
78 is A is the arm the AMF arm
and it basically showed scanning.
Picking up some fingers,
it showed that the the fingers on the 3:40,
so it was one of the things
that that was good about.
(4:33)
This was, I think it also showed some of the.
The calibration with the GNOME and
there was this little Nauman thing
which was designed to be held liable by
the by the fingers of the arm and the hand.
And it also had a magnet that kind of.
Extended down over the fingers and
the arm could reach up and actually
take it off of the thing off of the.
Detach it from the magnetic holder
and also put it back up there.
(5:03)
So I think we saw some of that.
After it was, it was there,
the arm would flip it over.
There was a triangle on the GNOME and the
video sector would find the triangle,
locate it,
the arm would go to six different
positions and it would calibrate
and then it would work out.
They.
All the transformations involved
and and then and then when it went
to see to find blocks on the table,
you and you were looking at the 3:40
you would actually see the fingers.
(5:40)
Of the arms sort of appear on the 3:40 as if.
You know they're being translated to the
view Plainview port of the 3:40 and,
and that's what we saw on on 78.
79 was something called teaching
children thunking, and it was just a.
(6:02)
It was unclear how they made it.
It was some kind of a of a picture
of a printing and and it wasn't
clear exactly what it what it was.
But anyway it was something OK.
So now 78 I think is about to where we were,
when when the big disaster happened.
Let's see maybe. Well, maybe not.
Let's say 78 says.
Let's see, so it's 78 beyond seven,
so let's see if 70 think yeah,
you're right sorry,
my indexes are fusing.
(6:38)
OK, so let's take a look at 78 cube here.
OK.
OK, and what we see is the
video sector poking around.
(7:01)
And this is this is being shot off the 3:40
and and it's just showing where it looks.
It didn't have enough core memory to
hold even a single frame video frame,
so it was just trying to track
edges and crawl around on edges.
And here it's found a cube.
And now here's the arm.
He's going to come down and
pick up the cube, and so.
The vector generator is a little
bit flakey there for a moment.
(7:32)
OK, now let's just scrub forward
a little bit and see.
OK, now this is these triangles,
those six triangles?
So those are the calibration points.
So so essentially you're seeing where where
the triangle was seen in the in the viewport,
when it when it was moved into
different places with the arm.
And here's more picking up.
Here's the actual arm AM farm.
And it's got a fair pile of blocks here.
(8:02)
And there's gospar.
And there's that moment it just put
the nomin back up there, I think.
And then it's kind of picking up
a handling blocks a little bit.
Yeah, more always stacking the blocks.
It's it's gotta stack.
That's not too terribly good a stack.
(8:31)
It's sometimes did better than that.
But OK, now it unstack
someone stortz some and.
Does some more things.
And.
(9:00)
And that's pretty much that so that that.
But that in general,
that's one of the better arm things
there were for what it shows,
it probably does a better job of
showing it than than most of the other
attempts to to show that we've seen.
OK, and now 79 is.
OK, the teaching showing,
thinking well now, how did they I
I and there's I think that that is
at display turned a little more.
I think about it.
(9:30)
We did have a supernova and it was
set up as as a display driver and
so we could actually make displays
at the school in Lexington and
very likely that's what that is.
However, it couldn't make
this lettering like that,
so exactly how they did this teaching?
Children thunking thing they must
have had some kind of a piece of
plastic or something that they
had that on and they brought up in
front of the screen or something.
(10:09)
Now we're teaching children
thinking, which is even better.
And now here the display turtle
is running around a fair amount.
Looks like he's making circle or part.
It's gradually spiraling and
spiraling out and that's and
now it's going back in yeah.
(10:30)
And and that's something that
children can do very easily,
and so that's something that they
enjoy doing and that is actually
quite informative for them to do.
And so let's see what else we have here.
And this is just more
spiraling back and forth.
Alright.
(11:03)
So that is the 80s.
Let's go to the 90s, the nines.
OK, 80 cube is. It's again a
pretty good one of of gospel and
EMF farm according to my notes,
so that indeed seems to be the case.
That's the same farm and TV be set up there.
(11:37)
And this is fairly organized
movie taking action where somebody
came in with a clacker and.
In the background there you can see on
that table there was another display
remoted display and here here it is.
(12:04)
That's the nomin and here it is moving
around to the calibration positions
and it didn't take it too long to to
find that thing and and position that
triangle and do what it had to do.
Now it has it flipped over.
Flip it around and now it's going to put
it back up on the onto the magnetic thing.
It's doing it pretty slowly for some reason.
Normally did it faster than that I think.
(12:32)
OK, now there it's coming in in range
of the magnetic holder could chunk it
goes onto the holder, then gripper
releases and and things so I know.
Oh, that's that's another cute thing.
It did. It noticed that it's kind of adjusted
it after it had it on there it it did.
Another little push on it so that
moves it away. So next time when it
comes into to to catch it, it it it's.
It's not a critical thing that it might
hit it. Hit it at the wrong place. Uhm?
OK, so now it's calibrated.
(13:10)
Now let's see what's gone now.
Apparently gonna take another take.
This guy is just a cameraman.
There's something I don't know him.
But sitting on his stand over here,
we can see this other.
Monitor and that monitor is just
slave to the 3:40 and basically.
With that you can look to see where it's
looking where the program is looking,
and you know whether the right
thing is happening or a reasonable
thing is happening or something.
(13:41)
OK, so it's found a cube and
it's moved over and put it down.
And let's say it builds a tower.
Now let's see it was this Eastlake
that looks like it might have been?
Yes, that is, Eastlake Donald Eastlake,
who is just lending a hand
for this demonstration.
(14:01)
But Donald Lease Lake,
was also around the lab.
And kind of he kind of wrote
better than the most of us.
So he had a tendency to to write
documents and memos and stuff. And.
OK, and here is more.
Building stacks and doing one thing another.
And that's East Lake.
(14:36)
And here's still more.
Pricing around with cubes and that's that,
and that's that. OK,
now yeah this this this display in the
background is is one of these HP displays,
so that's that's a random access display,
quite fast deflection.
As slave to the 3:40 so we can see
that it has the same pictures as 340.
(15:01)
It's it's spot size is not nearly as
good as a 340 is as a result of this
magnifier technology that HP had it.
The spot wasn't too good to focus,
but other than that it was much cheaper
and much less heavy and and so forth.
Oh wow, what do we got here?
This is this some kind of
a calibration thing or?
Well, I think I think that maybe a scan
across and that's just the intensity as we
encounter various cubes and stuff edges,
so it's a fairly complex scene of blocks.
(15:39)
I think we're just taking a horizontal scan
and as we as we encounter various edges, we.
We have a transition in the intensity
and then it it goes until it gets
to the next edge and so forth.
I think that's what it looks like.
What that might be,
I don't know if that's what that actually is.
That's right at the end of the clip.
(16:01)
OK, so that's 80.
OK, now we're ready for 81. Uh.
Oh, this is the one of Bill Martin.
And Bill Martin had a had a thesis
that he did on the 7090 where.
It did a fairly elaborate mathematical
notation printer you know with.
(16:33)
Multidimensions and integrals
and differentials and so forth.
So here he is looking at this.
Mathematics from an 1860 book or something?
Famous book and paging through that,
and then he's looking at some mathematics.
Here. He input some mathematics.
Here's a shot of his thesis, Martin.
(17:02)
January 1967. And I think that
might have been the secretary,
or conceivably his wife.
I'm not sure who's at the console, the PDP 6.
The microchips are spinning.
Uh.
And. No, now he's she's typing on the.
On the. 35 teletype and, and here
it is inputted, which she types.
(17:34)
She just typed something very simple, and.
And here's something a little
more complicated, and it does a
nice job of of printing that out.
And dumb.
Yeah I I think and it's saying math lab.
I think that he had originally
done this on the 7090 and I think
he moved it to the PDP 6 this.
(18:04)
This is probably running all on the PDP
6 so this is it was written on Lisp on
the 7090 so it wasn't too hard to move
and it originally had been a a decoupling.
The 7090 of course didn't have a
direct display or other than the
clouds which you didn't use and that
was but he had some kind of a thing.
I believe he did it on the PDP
one for his actual thesis.
But he had that body of code
sitting around. OK, here we are.
(18:30)
Back to cubes and OK,
that was quickly, then and then.
Here's this fellow Carl Angleman.
The other thing I should mention
about Bill Martin is that he
got cancer and passed away.
A very tragic loss and.
Yeah it was. It was in the early 80s.
We within uh, within a fairly short period.
We had David Marr passed away
and and Bill Martin pass away.
2 principles in the lab in
the 82 or three in frame.
(19:04)
Anyway, OK now. Here's the thing.
Here's what we were looking at when
when the big disaster happened.
OK, so here a little bit less
than halfway into the clip.
We have a shot of what.
Unfortunately we don't have very
many shots of so that I was trying to
stop it on this yesterday on Tuesday
and the mouse driver fried and it
crashed the machine entirely and
we lost the whole session. So OK.
(19:35)
So what we see here is a little bit
less than halfway into the clip.
On the left is the Moby memory and we
see it's it's two bays and we see.
Just about a third of the Big Bay,
which is where the the actual core
memory stack was the the majority of
the space inside the that whole Big
Bay was actually filled with with the
actual core memory and you know you
could actually see see the physical
core there and and begin to to look at it.
(20:07)
If when you opened it up all
this right hand Bay left.
Yeah, right hand Bay.
Is actually the interface,
so this at the top of it our lights
normal for memory that show the address
and data and then then there's a few
controls and this Rotary knob here is
is a Rotary knob for the self tester.
(20:30)
The memory had a built-in self
test are so you could turn that
Rotary knob to different places and
and the memory would go through a
pattern and you could you know put
probes in there and it was.
It was just really.
Amazingly remarkable how small the
signal was and so forth and so on.
Maybe we come out of that pattern,
but in the normal operation the memory that
that that Rotary now would be straight up,
and so on.
And then it also had a meter here,
and a little dilly so you
could do marginal test.
(21:05)
Marginal test is something that
the old computers had where you
could adjust the power supply
just very slightly a little bit,
and that way you could stress it so if.
If you had something that was was flaky,
you could try to to just adjust
the power supply just a little bit,
and maybe it would would fail more
and then maybe you could track
it down and and and find out what
was actually going on.
(21:31)
Oh OK,
now the next two days here to
the right of the mobi memory are
the Type 163 Dec memory that was
delivered with the machine.
And it the memory actually
occupied both of those bays,
although the the right
hand one wasn't too full.
And so and and and not too
long after this deck made,
it had also a very similar memory to this,
which which which it managed
to fit all in one Bay.
(22:04)
But that was 16 K of 36 bit
memory and it did have parity.
And in fact on the right hand Bay
we see another set of lights at the
top that was the parity option.
The the base machine.
The parody was not built into it, but it was.
It was an option that you could
buy an ad on the memory bus.
(22:30)
So when we first got our
machine it didn't have parity.
And I don't know if Dec gave it to us
or if we decided it was worth while
having the memory was pretty reliable.
So I I think they may have given
it to us or so. Just sort of.
Maybe it wasn't ready.
The engineering wasn't ready
initially anyway.
That those lights there go went
to the parody option and there
was just a rack or two of logic
in the top of the of the memory
there and that simply computed
the parity of 36 bits and.
(23:03)
And road and and check that.
And that was and that was
a bit more the parody.
OK, and and now here's a closer shot of
the self test panel on the mobi memory
we see the manufacturer which is fabric.
And the address and the data lights.
And then they self test and the
meter which is associated with the.
(23:35)
With a marginal test and let's see here
what else we might have here is we.
OK then then this next.
OK then we go to a short thing of
the cube and now the the the and
then we had a short clip of of the.
Display math Max mathematical display
and now what we're seeing here.
(24:03)
22 users are sitting down at at something
called the GE consoles. And these were.
Uh, something that we bought.
Quite early it was.
It it it was a thing that that had
been made by General Electric and we
made a whole new interface to it.
(24:32)
It actually had a Magneto restrictive
delay line as the memory in it and it
supported four of these consoles and
and we see one of the consoles a pretty
good shot here in the middle of the
screen they they view the monitor was
was it was it just a studio quality TV
set so it was a fairly high quality.
Television set as such as would be
used in a in a TV studio monitor of
the day and the keyboard that that
was used in those was was actually
the keyboard from a 33 teletype
which was none too terribly good,
and they had kludged a solinoid
to do the release.
(25:17)
The normally of course,
in a teletype that there's a mechanical
motor and one thing another that does the.
You you.
You hit the key and the key
actually has quite a lot of
mechanics and locks and so forth.
(25:32)
So once one key is down that it
actually mechanically prevents
any other key from going down.
And and there's little you know,
switches that are closed that
actually include the the character
code for the key that you've hit,
and then in order to reset it
you need A to yank up again.
Pretty hard on a on a reset bar,
which kind of ***** it again for the
next character, and they had just.
Rigged up a solenoid in order to do that.
(26:01)
So it's pretty kludgy,
although it it worked sort of
OK for the time.
It it it it it only had 40 characters wide,
so it was the the the amount of memory
it was had and so on was the length
of line was pretty totally short,
but on the other hand we did
have a wrap around thing and and
basically it for its day.
It was usable but but this is what we use
for displays and you know in the same.
(26:31)
Where are they?
Everyone else in the world?
At the commercial companies
customer of deck anyway,
was using strictly printing terminals
which were really much worse.
I would say even though the
screen was so small Stanford also,
you know was interested in displays
and trying to develop displays.
One thing.
Another OK here is somebody
sitting at a 35 teletype,
and here's more mathematical stuff.
Here's some more books and copying in.
(27:04)
Formulas off from the book.
Fairly hairy formulas.
And here, apparently we've got it copied in.
And and here's a diagram of this thing.
I think Martin said this simplification
package I believe did become part of maxima.
Later you'd have to get the final
word on that from from Joel Moses,
but who is the main integrator
of the maximum project?
And so on. But I'm pretty sure
Martin stuff went into that.
(27:38)
And here's some things and OK.
And oh, and here's doing integrating stuff,
so this is actually an
early version of maxima.
I don't know if it was called
maximine that at that point,
but OK, so that's 81.
The integral program, of course,
was written by Joe Moses that was his
thesis and OK now here is the other.
(28:04)
The smoking the pipe on the GE
console is this Carl Angleman guy,
and he was also interested in mathematics
and also had some mathematic programs.
He was. Wasn't was really sort of a visitor.
He he was really associated with the Mitre
Corporation and he was sort of trying
to serve as an as an interface between
Mitre and and US and something and.
(28:32)
And of course Mitre was connected
with the military and so forth. So.
He he just sort of did things he wasn't.
Quite as winning, but he
was sort of a nice guy.
OK, let's see what we see here.
This and he had a program and this I
think this this display here that we're
seeing is very likely his program.
(29:00)
And it also could do mathematical type stuff.
Not as fancy as maximum,
I would say as a general thing,
but but it did have.
It was an early effort and
I'm sure had its points.
OK, that's
8283 logo. OK, it says logo
werma OK so This is why I had.
Yeah I know that to 3:40 it's not
entirely clear whether this is a 340
or this data general. Display and.
(29:42)
The only way you could talk to tell the
difference would be that spot size,
so the 3:40 has quite a bit finer points,
and these lines are fairly wide width,
so I I think this may very well
be the the logo display it was
driven by a data Gen Supernova,
which is an early mini computer and.
(30:06)
It was, you know,
just after data General got started.
I think it was about the second or
third model that they put out and.
Oh, it was, uh, about uh,
it was a rack width and and and
a full rack depth and about.
Maybe 20 inches high or so and
it weighed probably 100 hundred.
(30:31)
£50 is possibly carry it for
a couple of people and it was
a fairly fast little machine.
Actually it I think it had eight
K of memory and and two Michael,
you know 16 bit and and maybe two
microseconds or so cycle time.
OK, so that's that. That's 83 now
84 robot what do we got here 84 is
again the AM farm calibrating again.
(31:09)
And this looks like a fairly
good thing of the calibration.
I think this is where it may screw
up a couple times. Well, who knows?
OK, so again it's playing with the
gnome and it's doing the calibration.
Errors gospar gossipers.
Adjusting the camera settings.
(31:33)
And. Here we are taking pictures
again snapping our thing.
Again, it's. Arm is frosting ramp
building towers and stuff here.
Here again, we're looking at the 3:40
and and we see the this transformation of
the finger grippers right onto the 3:40.
(32:00)
So you sort of get a realistic view
of exactly what that would look like.
Notices as it rotates down, and so forth.
It's it's doing all the transformations
through all the joints of the arm,
and so as they rotate everything,
all projects properly and everything.
There's a calibration data.
And Cuban there we are.
Finding the Cuban.
And picking it up and then scanning around,
finding an internal edge.
(32:30)
In this case,
that was always a a tight thing.
You know,
we depending on the how the lighting is,
it may either be possible or not to
to find these internal edges because
the cube was purely white there is no.
Gradient on the queue,
but also depending on how the light
is from the different directions,
it's it's either fairly easy or
impossible to define the internal edge
of the cube we we worried about that
quite a bit, which was probably mostly laws.
OK, here's a here's the calibration data.
(33:01)
The six triangles.
And cube here.
OK here we have a stack.
We're also picking up some
some oblong blocks.
And.
We got a little bit of a bug in the
vector generator there for a moment.
And. The three forty had a fairly
elaborate vector generator, and.
(33:30)
And increment mode generator
and character generator.
All of these worked at 1
1/2 microseconds per point.
So and the character generator was was
made out of a handwoven thing, it was.
Made out of Big corps,
the corps were probably about 2
inches in diameter and for each
character a wire was threaded
through certain of the cores.
In order to encode at what
times you need it to increment,
you know which, which thing, and so on,
and so that that was the handmade thing,
and then then later they made
him a woven wire for a time.
(34:10)
They actually used the weaving machines
circa the old mill, and so forth.
To make a read only memory by.
Sliding wires through these cores or not
and and giving yourself a read only memory.
And there was actually a company
that did that for a while.
So before semiconductor memories it was
actually quite hard to have a a read
only memory for storing data like that.
(34:37)
OK,
so here's now we're back to the beginning,
so we're just seeing that again,
that's calibration.
OK,
so now we're ready for 85 screen.
And this again, I think, is probably
engelmann's mathematics program.
And he, yeah, there's this in that.
(35:03)
Then here we see.
Engelman the data products
line printer a little more
than halfway through the clip.
He's going to the printer and
and that's the data product line
printer that that printer I think
cost around $35,000 or something.
It was 640 lines per minute,
which was reasonably fast.
It was before before the days of
having a printer on the PDP one
I mean and and early days of PDP
six we had no high speed printing
at all and we just printed out on
teletype machines and sometimes
offline teletype machines.
(35:41)
From we could punch paper tape
if if nothing else you could
punch paper tape somewhat faster.
60 characters per second and then
you could set up a big batch of
paper tape and listed on the.
On the teletype. All the IBM machines.
Of course,
the big computer centers had
printers earlier,
so at some point we had to get a
printer and we did and and this is
this data products printer it was.
(36:07)
It it had, it was based on
a on a magnetic principle.
It had a hammer bank and and each
hammer was kind of setting up on 2.
Pieces of spring steel and there was
a little flag in the hammer and there
was a bunch of permanent magnets.
So essentially and and then there
was a drum that was behind the paper
that was just continuously rotating.
(36:35)
So the the printer worked by knowing
when what the position of this drum was.
The drum had etched characters on it and
when the drum was in the right position.
The hammer would fire through and and
the ribbon was in front of the paper and
it would just basically hit the paper.
The ribbon against the paper against the
drum and that would make the character and.
(37:01)
And it was a pretty winning
printer for its day.
It was that was quite a bit
simpler mechanical action than
than than other printers,
you know which had chains
and and other funny things.
This printer had uppercase only,
so it was 64 characters character set.
And. And we used it quite
a lot for a lot of years.
(37:30)
And it could.
So anyway, that's the that's the
you did like products line printer.
It had a logic gate that around behind it.
You can't see it in this picture.
There was the the whole back of
the machine in the lower area,
sort of opened and there was a a gate and
it was kind of full with with electronics
that card card based electronics
that that drove the printer and did
whatever was necessary to make it go.
(38:03)
We we had an interface to it.
OK so now here's Engelmann
showing something or other and.
And that's and that's clip 85.
OK, 86 is bongo so I think
we'll just skip over that 87.
Is cube. Something,
so let's see what that is.
(38:31)
OK, here we are.
With this off the 3:40 watching
the video sector scan around trying
to find the cube it looks like.
It's kind of crawling around the
cube and kind of remembering where
it was and picking up OK there.
It's got the cube located.
And it's already calibrating.
Everything is going to come down.
Pick up the cube.
Oh, now I turned it around.
Didn't project right. So that's.
(39:02)
But anyway, the display slight problem there.
Yeah. And now it's going to
pick it up the other way.
This is the oblong thing,
and there's a deal whereby it can pick.
Pick it up and and and change its grip and
turn it around and pick it up sideways and.
Set it on its end instead of on
its side or things like that.
(39:30)
I think that's what that may be doing there.
OK, now it's doing some
more scanning around here.
It's advance, it's some more here.
It's found something it's gonna pick
that up or not doing any calibration.
This the six triangles business
is is the calibration.
I don't know.
With the order of these clips
where they may be out of order,
or maybe they felt they had to re calibrate.
OK.
(40:03)
Oh, I mean maybe that's the reason
why that that miss projected was.
Was it the calibration data was
wrong and and therefore when it
went to back projected it it?
It did completely the wrong thing.
I actually, maybe that's right.
So the reason why that that thing?
When they picked up the cube
and tried to turn it around,
it sort of collapsed on the screen.
Was that the the the transformation
was completely screwed up,
so therefore we had to re calibrate in
order to try to get it straightened out.
(40:32)
So so now it's it's looking
for the block again.
And it's found the block.
And let's see if it picks
up like right here we go,
picking, picking up the block.
Ah, now that's more like it.
So so now it picked up
and it rotated properly,
and so the the transformation has been fixed.
(41:02)
And unfortunately it sets it down,
sort of off the screen or.
But anyway, we could see
some of what's going on OK,
and then here's a picture of
the real alarm. And again,
it's going to pick up some and.
Do this and that.
Now here it's doing a calibration to
find the the vertical level of the
of the table that that that's sort
of a a working surface is made of
Styrofoam so that it won't damage
itself if it goes down into it,
and so I can just kind of go down
and has a micro switches on the tips
of the of the grippers so it can see
where that is and and that's what it
just did in order to see what the Z
level of the working surface was.
(41:53)
And then it's getting ready to
do this calibration again.
(42:00)
Yeah, and so that's nerd is
doing the calibration again,
Gaspar there and so on.
OK, so here it is playing cubes
again, taking metaking stack
apart and sorting them I guess.
And here's more and here's more.
OK, so that's more arm, that's 87.
(42:30)
OK, now we go to 8880 die.
OK, we've actually. Oh now.
This is actually the finished.
The film with the color OK, now that's TVC.
And now now we see there that
this large brown thing is.
Is is something we actually
made is a a better video sector
with a big tube in it and.
(43:02)
And this is Dave Waltz.
Narrating this, I can tell
him his voice. And its color.
And we can see that the here
it is printing on the printer.
That's Nick horn.
Berthold Horn is his office,
actually next door here,
right to where we are right now, I think.
Yeah, Unicorn, we're told
on VK pH yeah that's him so.
He doesn't look like he's too
terribly different from what I just
saw him briefly the other day, but.
(43:39)
He explains how the robot can learn
new concepts OK and then and then.
Here's a little lecture from Marvin Minsky,
and again, Marvin Minsky looks about
the same and that as they did the last
time I saw him, which is 2 long ago.
And here he is talking about. Well,
it's just various programs in this and that.
(44:02)
And and also I think talk some about
Winston's program, maybe and towers and.
Such a thing?
Product and then here is Terry Winograd's
assured Lu thing and this is a color display.
And of course we didn't have a color display.
So so this this was made by.
Making slides in a slide shop or
something like that, I believe,
is sending this data out to an
external shop and going to quite
a bit of trouble to to to make
that the the color thing there.
(44:43)
Supper.
Small fraction of the available
because the machine has good ideas
about where to look for lying
and this this I think is walz's
thesis and he's describing it here.
It it basically.
Does parses the individual.
(45:05)
Interior lines and the vertices
variously finding skeletons and OK.
And now here we are back to the MF Farm,
where we're doing some of this.
And here it is finding vertices and
let's you know what's this doing now.
(45:35)
Allows the arm to turn a crank.
OK, now this this is something that.
Yeah, that's some finger we had there.
I think that did have some strange gauges
on it, but that was much less used.
That was unfortunately very. Emptiness.
OK, and here's foments thesis.
(46:00)
Which has something to do
with towers and so on.
Scott Fahlman is been a
professor at CMU for many years,
done various things.
And it shows how with one hand
you can build a unbalanced tower.
OK.
OK, now let's see here what we graphics.
(46:31)
Yeah, I see the this
actually has some production.
Thomas Binford is at Stanford and
for many years Foman fining Freud,
Ehrhorn, Jerome Lerman.
Chirag is Japan.
Famous researcher Japan David Silver.
It was David Silver was a son of Rollo
Silver, who's a friend of Marvin
and David Silver had dyslexia and
people didn't know what dyslexia was.
(47:06)
Too much in those days or
what to do about or anything.
So David Silver kind of dropped out
of high school and he was around the
lab and he had some good ideas and
unfortunately I don't think we have.
So far I haven't seen any films of his stuff,
but he built his own mice and he had
some stuff with that that did some.
Real time feedback.
They had a fairly simple turtle that was
and it was looking at a video sector.
(47:36)
Was looking at it and it was
sort of direct coupled.
Loosely coupled feedback so that
you know it wasn't doing all
the transformations or anything,
but it was sort of tight
tightly well tightly coupled.
In other words,
you know we move that the turtle just a
little bit and immediately see that in the.
In the video sector and attempt to
generate a transformation between the two,
and basically you know get the turtle
to wear where you wanted it to go
without any without any actual sensors
on the turtle itself, purely by vision,
and without detailed calibration.
(48:12)
OK, Dave, Walt Patrick Winston.
Robert Woodham.
OK they're all.
OK,
so that's.
That's that.
And let's see what was this?
Supervised OK, so this this was just before.
(48:36)
Winston became director of the lab.
It looks like. OK, so that is 88.
That's kind of a more of a finished product.
Clip. Let's go to 89.
OK, there's a 340 and this
looks like it's probably
this eye tracking business.
(49:00)
Let's see here.
Yeah, I think this is just
demonstrating this I tracker.
Is probably the NASA I tracker.
We had several eye trackers over the years,
but one of them was done by some group
at NASA and we just interface that
our machine fairly simple mindedly.
I think this is just demonstrating
someone looking around.
OK, so that's not too much.
That's that's 89.
(49:32)
OK.
So now we go through a ten MP4.
OK 90 logo.
Logo 340 ternel you think?
Yeah, so this is a fairly elaborate
squirrel type of thing that kids can do
very with very simple program, very elegant.
(50:01)
OK, now we go for worm which is
also number 90 and this again is is
a display hack where it just with
a simple program as a display of
a directory or micro tape maybe.
And here's this little worm fish
kind of flowing around.
It's a simple rule.
(50:30)
I'm not sure this.
I'm not sure if this is a bealer worm or not.
There there was some of this
that had some connection.
I'm not sure if this is it or not that they.
They had actually found some traces in the
bottom of the sea or something like that,
where there are these patterns
and and people didn't understand
where these patterns came from,
and they eventually found out that
these patterns were were made by,
you know, very early.
Animals that were executing
these simple programs and making
patterns to sort of look.
(51:07)
So there I guess there worms you could
call them and and they they they leave
that that fairly elaborate track which
didn't manage to be preserved for many.
Many, probably millions of years OK.
Now here's the big turtle.
And it's Jim just turning around here. And.
(51:36)
Smarter long turtle.
It's making a squirrel
or a spiral or something.
OK, so that's it.
91 is the big turtle.
92 more big turtle.
This picture was very popular with the kids.
It was this was the first turtle
ever made and people you know
it just kept staying and use.
(52:02)
It wasn't the most advanced and
this or that but it was it.
As far as the kids were concerned,
it was one of the best ones.
Most popular.
OK, so there it is drawing away 93 cube.
OK, let's see.
We've got some some blocks.
Yeah, you could ever.
(52:30)
I can hear, let's see,
zoom in, zoom out a little bit.
Looks like it made it
fairly high stack there.
OK, now here is a a.
I think this may be a contour map
of of of that fake human hand
just showing a complex thing.
We unfortunately we didn't.
We had very little thing this this
may be the only effort to to really
deal with complex smooth objects even
present day and I think that maybe that
linowitz guy or whatever it is basically.
(53:10)
So there's.
Steps to draw draw card tours.
OK, that's that's 93.
Now 94.
OK, this 94 now this is a it looks
like this solar data and it may
have been sort of this propagation.
(53:32)
It looks like it may be a display hack.
I don't know what that is,
but this guy that did this is still around.
Actually I haven't still haven't
contacted him in many years.
He used to be my roommate is
my name is Mike Beeler and he
had gotten this data from some
contact at Harvard or something,
and so he just sort of did that as a.
Demonstration for them.
At the time it was pretty
interesting for them.
OK,
here we go in 95 turtle again the big turtle.
(54:06)
And. It's making a.
It's actually making some lettering,
it look like and then then then later.
This is a small tour.
This is a Plexiglas turtle.
Well wait a minute now
I see there's a tail.
Yeah, this is from underneath and this
is still the big turtle maybe yeah yeah,
it looks like we got a plexiglass piece
of plexiglass OverDrive supported out of.
(54:35)
Just looked up for the bottom. Here.
Now you can see it turtle course,
yeah, and it's just making a
hexagon or something and squirrel.
So the turtles are great things for teaching
kids and and you know, they they're.
Well, they've been used a little
bit in all these years,
but and there's a few places I mean.
Brian Harvey is been plunking away and
a few teachers that that were part
of the old thing have been, you know,
soldiering on all these years.
(55:08)
But yet.
The whole thing has not taken off
anything like what it should have,
and it's really quite a.
Quite a tragedy that it didn't and
it just now has another chance.
Just very recently, Negroponte has this $100.
Portable computer thing for kids and
Seymour Papert has kind of come out
of retirement and and Alan Kay is
also involved in it and and basically
they have a thing where where you can
run logo right on your web browser.
(55:45)
Now we're just saying any web
browser that has Java,
you know it has a box and you can
type in a logo program and it will
execute the logo program and and
there's another window that has the
turtle and will draw turtle things
and so that's a demonstration.
They're going to hack it up so that it has.
(56:02)
The full thing.
In that way you know that will
make logo instantly available to
sort of everyone over the web.
And I remember doing logo like stuff
with that at a summer camp with Java
where he wrote like a robot class
and then we just drive it around.
Well, you know,
it's just there's some of that and
that's good that that was done.
However,
you know of course logo involved
programming and they involve switches,
you know.
(56:35)
And there were sensors on the
things and basically you could
follow a wall and you could.
Move and bounce around and and.
It was a full programming language.
Yeah, sure,
and so you could actually write
programs and and these days,
as far as I can tell you know,
very few kids.
Actually,
they may have something they can play with,
but in terms of something that they can
really write a program and and you know,
let's put it this way,
opportunities are much more limited
if and and they overhead involved
if they do want to get involved
in some programming language,
then you know the amount of stuff you
have to learn is is quite a bit greater and.
(57:17)
So I have documentation you
have to plow through and so on.
This stuff, even small kids.
I think these kids in in in Lexington
or third grade or something.
Yeah,
the video looked like oh and
actually we we
we don't have a picture of it here,
but, uh, a gal named Radia Perlman.
(57:37)
Who is, you know later,
went on to become a some note in
the Internet and she's was at Sun,
and I think she's now at
Microsoft or whatever.
But she was in the logo group and
she had a idea for a card programmer.
So this this device.
Was three plexiglass strips and the
strips had slots in them and the slots
underneath them had photo sensors
and there were about 10 photosensors.
(58:13)
And you had these cards.
You take a plastic card and you could
punch holes in the bottom of it.
And and basically then,
when you did that and then
you put the card in the slot,
the computer could sense which card it
was that you put in, because it could.
(58:31)
It lined up with those holes and the
holes would either go through there or not,
depending upon that.
So and then it was also set up
so that in some cases you had,
you could put several cards in
one slot at once.
In other words the the the,
the big cards that were the
main commands would have.
Lots of holes which was always punched
and then the small card which would
give you the number you know like
5 steps forward or something would
have information in those slots.
(59:05)
So you could actually put in
two cards at once,
and the computer could tell you
exactly which cards at work,
and with that just very tiny
kids could could program,
and I'm not sure what the record low was.
I if probably four or five years.
Just just really on it.
It had a few other things like it.
It had a light that that would advance
so you know as as each step was executed
you could tell which one it was
executing because the light associated
with that step would would light up.
(59:40)
And in each of these strips
had a button on it,
so you could push the button and
that would initiate the execution,
and so the whole thing was very very
very simple and even the smallest
kid could could program with it
and and and make squirrels and and
do various things and it it it.
(60:03)
I don't know.
I think people have the hard way
more or less discovered this again,
but at the time of course there
was all kinds of nonsense about,
you know.
There's certain things theories about
certain capabilities of kids weren't
developed until a certain time,
and this one thing another,
and it was all nonsense and and
actually the smallest kid actually
has the fundamental concepts
involved in programming and program.
Given the right stuff. OK, OK.
(60:31)
OK, good.
