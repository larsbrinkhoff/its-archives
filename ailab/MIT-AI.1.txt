RIVIN@MX.LCS.MIT.EDU 01/05/87 02:42:28 Re: rooms for rent
Three rooms are available in a shared house in Cambridge.
The house is located on Broadway, a block away from
Tech Square. The present inhabitants of the house are
a computer professional, a mathematician and a MechE
grad student. One of these (me) is going West and would
like to sublet his room (one of the three).
 Since the house is shared, the rent depends on the number
of inhabitants. Rents depend (slightly) on the rooms,
since some rooms are bigger then others. With a total of
four people, the rent would be roughly $150 (+ utilities)
Important house restrictions are NO SMOKING and NO PETS.
I have negleted to mention that the present inhabitants
are all male, but that is an accident rather then a result
of any kind of policy.

Please reply by email to me (rivin@mc or rivin@sail) 
or call 492-3654. If you call,
don't ask for Igor, since I am going away today. Ask for
Dave or Mike, as they are the ones there. The best time
to call is at night (between 6 and 8 and between 10 and midnight)..

                    AN HISTORICAL VIDEO TAPE

     Doug  Engelbart  invented  the  mouse, and many of the
     other features of user interfaces that we now take for
     granted.    His  vision of high-performance work teams
     led him to develop many other facilities that are more
     slowly  gaining  acceptance:  structured documents and
     hypertext, conferencing,  multi-media  displays.    In
     this  tape of Doug Engelbart's presentation at the ACM
     Conference on the History of the Personal Workstation,
     Doug  talks about his vision, his career, the agencies
     that supported him (including ARPA  under  it's  first
     director,  J.  C.  R.  Licklider), and the systems his
     group developed.    The  tape  includes  a  20  minute
     segment  from the Augment system demo at the 1968 Fall
     Joint Computer Conference  in  San  Francisco.    Tape
     length:  1 hour 20 minutes.

                      Call for Papers

  Second International Conference on Architectural Support
for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS-II)

                    Rickey's Hyatt House
          Palo Alto, California, October 5-8, 1987

         Sponsored by ACM and IEEE Computer Society



This is a reprise of the highly successful symposium held in
1982. Many of the ideas discussed at that time are now
reaching the marketplace.  This time, we intend to focus on
experimental analyses of architectures and performance
evaluations of prototype systems, including application-
specific designs. The time is ripe to review progress and
identify future directions.

Full papers (approximately 5000 words) are solicited in:

* Language and OS-Influenced Processor Designs

* Architecture-Influenced Compiler and OS Design

* Experimental Analysis of Instruction Set and Other
Architectural Design Choices

* Performance Evaluation of Prototype and Newly Available
Commercial Systems

We also solicit short (1000 word) high quality technical
abstracts on innovative commercial and prototype systems
that address topics of relevance to this conference. Full
presentations will be expected.

Five copies of submitted papers should be sent to the
program chairman at the address below, and will be accepted
for evaluation until February 1, 1987. Submissions will be
read by members and designated reviewers of the program
committee:

Randy Katz, U.C. Berkeley (chairman)
Forest Baskett, Silicon Graphics
David Ditzel, AT&T Bell Laboratories
James Goodman, University of Wisconsin
John Hennessy, Stanford University
Edward McCreight, Xerox PARC
Steven Muchnick, Sun Microsystems
Richard Sites, DEC Hudson
Alan Smith, U.C. Berkeley
Chuck Thacker, DEC Systems Res. Center
Philip Treleaven, University College London
Mario Tokoro, Keio University

Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by May
15, 1987.  Accepted papers must be typed on special forms
and received by the program chairman by July 1, 1987.

A number of special activities are planned in conjunction
with the conference, including tutorials, invited papers,
and a special journal issue. The best submitted papers will
be considered for publication in this issue.

possibility of an additional position to begin July 1,1987 or 1988.  

Areas of specialization are open, but candidates should demonstrate inter-
disciplinary research and teaching abilities; the successful candidate will be
not only an excellent linguist or psychologist (or both) but will address 
questions that cut across traditional disciplinary boundaries. Primary 
appointment will be in either the Department of Modern Languages and 
Linguistics or in the Department of Psychology; candidates will also partic-
ipate in the newly organized Cognitive Studies Program, which involves
faculty not only from these departments but also from Philosophy, Mathematics,
Computer Science, Neurobiology and Behavior, and Human Development and
Family Studies.  

Possible areas of research include natural language processing and parsing 
models, computational vision, formal models of knowledge representation and/or
reasoning, syntactic and semantic representation, language acquisition (first 
and second), models of conceptual change, decision theory, speech perception, 
psycholinguistics, and computational linguistics.  

Exceptionally well-qualified and experienced individuals may apply at the 
Associate or Full Professor level, although an appointment at a higher rank 
has not yet been authorized.  

Dossier including cv, sample reprint or preprint of completed research, and 
letters of recommendation sent directly from three referees should go to:  
Cognitive Studies Search Committee, c/o Suzanne Wurster, Department of 
Psychology, Uris Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY   14853.  Review of 
applications will begin January 15, 1987.  CORNELL IS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY/

          We meet the first Thursday of each month to share questions and
          tips, to listen to speakers from the industry on VMS and Unix
          topics, and to socialize.  Please come!

          This months topic:

          Shuffling Pages--a Novice's Guide to VMS's Virtual Memory System
                    Shava Nerad, System Programmer for MIT's Information
                    Systems group, will describe the mechanisms of a virtual
                    memory system's (VMS's) memory management scheme, with
                    commentary on how to use your virtual memory system for
                    optimal efficiency by taking advantage of these features.
                    Many of the principals (but less of the details) apply
                    to Unix systems as well.

                    Although this presentation is gauged toward a fairly
                    naive programmer/system manager, we hope that it will be
                    of interest to users of all levels.

Subject: space in Watertown apartment open
Date: Tue, 06 Jan 87 13:36:30 -0500
From: jim@ATHENA.MIT.EDU

Two fairly recent alums are looking for a third person, preferably someone who
is employed or is a graduate student, to share a large three-bedroom apartment
in Watertown.  Rent is $275/month plus utilities (oil heat and a gas stove)
and includes:

        o bedroom on your own floor (we have the second and third floor
                of a house) with your own FULL bathroom (there are two in
                the apartment).

        o attic and basement space.

        o living room (with cable TV), dining room, and den.

        o good sized kitchen with lots of cupboards.

        o washer and dryer in the basement.

        o off-street parking.

        o plants, grass and trees (outside).

        o a very pleasant, quiet neighborhood on the Watertown/Belmont border.

We're right on the 73 bus line from Harvard Sq. to Waverly and a short walk
from the bus line that terminates in Watertown Sq.  The house is 3 miles
from Harvard Sq. and 5 miles from MIT (15 minutes by car), about a mile
beyond the Star Market at the intersection of Mount Auburn and Belmont Sts.
For commuting we are 5-10 minutes from Route 2 and the Mass Pike.

If you are interested, give me a call.

YOGA is about your relationship with your life, and actualizing all of your
potential as a human being.  KUNDALINI is a science of exercise and meditation
designed to make the body and mind powerful, healthy, and effective.

In Kundalini Yoga, you make a commitment to your own self-development, and use
a disciplined practice of exercises to create a dynamic energy in your life.  
The result:  you maximize your ability to make an impact in this world.

Over IAP, the MIT Yoga Club is offering a beginner's introductory course
to Kundalini Yoga.  In our classes we will exercise, breathe, and sing.  
You will feel both invigorated and relaxed.

We have four classes each week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, from
5:30 to 6:30 pm, at Burton House (410 Memorial Drive, 2nd floor).
You may come to as many as you like each week.

Take this opportunity and make a step towards improving your health, happiness,
and successfulness.

                        PLACE:  NE43-512A

                           Refreshments at 10:45 am
                               Talk at 11:00 am



                         Data Types and Communication

                                Prof. W. Weihl
                            Refreshments at 1:30 pm
                                Talk at 1:45 pm


                                   Abstract

Distributed computing environments such as the one at LCS exhibit a high
degree of heterogeneity:  many different kinds of machines are connected by
a network, with different machines potentially running different operating
systems and programs written in different programming languages. These
differences can make it difficult to share resources such as programs and data.
The LCS Common System, currently being designed here at LCS, is intended to
support program composition in a heterogeneous distributed environment,
thus making it easier to share resources. The first talk will begin with an
overview of the goals of the Common System and the basic approach being taken.
It will then discuss the semantics of the communication primitives that have
been designed for the Common System. The second talk will discuss the problems
that arise because of differences in data types in different programming
languages, and will describe the support provided by the Common System for
solving these problems.

There will be two talks on the LCS Common System:

                        DATE:  FRIDAY, JANUARY 9, 1987

                        PLACE:  NE43-512A


                           Communication Semantics

                               Prof. B. Liskov
                           Refreshments at 10:45 am
                               Talk at 11:00 am



                        Data Types and Communication

                               Prof. W. Weihl
                          Refreshments at 1:30 pm
                               Talk at 1:45 pm


                                  Abstract

Distributed computing environments such as the one at LCS exhibit a high
degree of heterogeneity:  many different kinds of machines are connected
by a network, with different machines potentially running different operating
systems and programs written in different programming languages. These
differences can make it difficult to share resources such as programs and data.
The LCS Common System, currently being designed here at LCS, is intended to
support program composition in a heterogeneous distributed environment,
thus making it easier to share resources. The first talk will begin with
an overview of the goals of the Common System and the basic approach being
taken. It will then discuss the semantics of the communication primitives
that have been designed for the Common System. The second talk will discuss
the problems that arise because of differences in data types in different
programming languages, and will describe the support provided by the
Common System for solving these problems.

                       ABSTRACT

The influence diagram is a network for structuring Bayesian decision
analysis problems.  The nodes represent uncertain quantities, goals,
and decisions,  and the arcs indicate probabilistic dependencies and
the observability of information.  The graphical hierarchy promotes
discussion by emphasizing the stucture of a problem and the
relationship among variables, while allowing the details of assessment
to be completed later.  Because the components have a basic mathematical
interpretation, even a qualitative diagram has a precise meaning.
When the quantitative information is complete, the influence diagram can be
evaluated in a generalization of decision tree solving.  Examples using
influence diagrams will be drawn from Decision Analysis, Information 
Theory, Dynamic Programming, Kalman Filtering, and Expert Systems.
In the latter case we ask the question: "Why do probabilists insist 
on looking at everything backwards?"

Subject: Roommates wanted

Two MIT undergrads (5th-year) seeking two roommates for East Cambridge
apartment.  The apartment is 2.5 floors + basement of 3-story house at
428 Cambridge Street (near 5th street).  Two rooms:  one small
(~9x10), with adjacent attic for storage ($250), one large (~15x15?)
($300).

If you have lots of junk, this place is definitely for you, since
there's lots of space with either room, plus we have the entire
basement.  Full kitchen facilities; laudry when we get around to
fixing the washer.

Male or female welcome; we don't think we want pets; no smokers.
Cooking arrangements completely independent (our schedules are chaotic
at best).

Approx. 15 minute walk to Tech^2 or east side of MIT through safe
residential neighborhoods (you can walk home at 2AM in complete
safety).  About 5 minutes from Star Market on foot.  Convenient to T
(Lechemere) and buses to Harvard^2.

Phone # 576-4715 evenings, say you're calling about the room.  You can
try 3-4261 if you can't get anyone there (not unlikely), and ask for
Robert Krawitz.

GROUP CHESS

Monday, January 12th at 3 p.m. 
E51-136.  

In ordinary chess, one person on each side decides which move to make.  In grou!
p
chess, several people on each side work as a team to decide on a move.  The
performance of a team depends not only on the chess abilities of individual mem!
bers,
but also on how well they organize themselves.

We are interested in the issue of coordinating independent thinkers, as must be!
 done
in groups and organizations, and in distributed computer processors.  How do gr!

work out coordination problems in complex tasks, and when is group performance
better than, equal to, or worse than the level of the best group player?

We will play group chess, and explore alternative ways of organizing teams, pos!
sibly
including computer-supported communications.

     I have a Schwinn Varsity to sell by the end of the month...it had a
complete overhall done on it only a year ago and recently had both tires
replaced...it's in good shape.

     Price: $75 or best offer

Leave a message at 494-8596 or send a message to this account, ET@EE...or
both.

I am looking for a student named Robert T. Chang.  I have his wallet and
judging from its contents, I would assume that he needs it badly.  Would
appreciate it if anyone knowing him would give him this message. Thanks.
